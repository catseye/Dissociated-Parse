# The Lion, the Witches, and the Weird Road

## Chapter 1

It was satisfied except Toto.

To rescue their queer little horses.

Even to protect them and untiring as Dorothy were at last Woodman caught Toto into the road and started the Kalidahs was what.

Day there wore round hats that rose to only the Great Oz of ripening grain, with delight.

Caught the Scarecrow one of the woman of emeralds so that as soon as was at home arose from their heads the cyclone shone just as he had once met the Silver Shoes of chattering and noise and the birds properly oiled, and the shore suddenly gave a row and kicked over the back yard of the Lion's, and the cackling of a group that was done herself.  In order.

Dorothy and her friends ate a steep breakfast, and watched a short Munchkin baby.

She thought he when they saw the poisonous scent of the dish that she spread over them and the Yellow found him, and so suddenly climbed to the pretty silk dress beside him and sat down at the morning.

They came to Dorothy.

She also lost its gloom saw.  _She also lost its cheese saw._

It with gems shook so suddenly that they agreed he tried cleared listening what far from the travelers suddenly upon the ground.

That made his hat and boots and clothes wood and gazed thoughtfully at her the magic words, and soon the band was thick.

Owned half a few more of the broad sweep of flat country of his pretty clothes.

He had shown to the poisonous scent of the poppy bed.

The Mice green meadows in the road easiest Oz was green to the truck of the couch saw.

But one little Monkey he made a chair with a high arched roof, and the walls.

He could call the swaying they bent them carefully many shops before them or not.

Carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy and her friends in safety, and when get to a telescope before again, so she bravely resolved his head soon be he which she noticed one the green the Scarecrow's where to try heard a crash, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy had been standing silently taken to his wings, where they walked up out of it spread with the hill Dorothy made of blue tops and carried her arms swiftly through the ladder until lived.

Beautiful a low rumble was a crash beside her trick.  Of the silver ones, flew into a piece and were soon out of the hill.

To beat her with any way of the Great Oz to the Palace of Oz.

The Tin Woodman told the bottom.

She was going thanking the air, she had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.

That when to have beat her old friend with all directions shook his surprise, that.

To feel hungry for the loss of the Emerald City.

The poor Scarecrow, they after a moment bowed in.

The pole in green flowers was so frightened that Dorothy was a dozen of the people beyond the little girl, and not far away the pail was, however light that none of them could climb.

Picking out, with with them, the Winged Monkeys.

That the end of their spectacles would do morning came up, and immediately began he wanted to feel lonely among the Munchkins.

To ride on and at the Gates it work with green hats and chopped so well the screen had set her down upon it.  Knew where no brains did not have to follow her the presence of Oz had expected her head ate enough for the City and Toto, and enjoyed her, and was surprised him that the stream of a little door and Dorothy tigers in all of them, and at night.

To make it airtight.

To hold its green color.

To put out his jaws and panted and looked at last to cheer them.

Which way they were into running to their odor from the peace in one.  A man toward her own tears upon their minds, all dressed.

The green glow whispered to the little girl that the Emerald City whispered to the big yellow rooms that were forty times a wolf.

To follow some wild animal written.

As every man walked jumping down, after a big clothes basket the road of yellow brick gave a small spring and landed directly upon a cyclone, barking merrily all to be a cannon ball.

Anything in a great deal he of the Gates gazed upon it she feared that was shaped like burnished silver and sparkled with his greatest wish, if sweetly as they moved among all directions too tired that even the next morning, for they rested.

He was gray also, from terror.

Where the others stepped upon a great roar a time the middle blistered the house and the rains washed it away when to think for, the Tin Woodman of his head and arms and legs of skins might get out of the first thing, and would have every night of Winged Monkeys again.

Dorothy's became all tired out, and had it took the road.

All her were not nearly cared for here and there.

Giving the wonderful sight exactly a Head of scrambled eggs.

Jumped away from Oz in amazement in a pretty green silk gown.

As if to go back to his good fortune was his old in wonder.

He looked inside the news and saw standing in abundance that the reason came.

Oz had met where the Tin Woodman's began breathes it.

For the were tightly rusted together it had baked the plowed land every side of Winged Monkeys, like tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others.

To make the long legs so in the sun she made Dorothy so angry and dashed a raft of Fire was out of his greatest wish.

To go in some hidden among the kitchen floor.

They had grown the place of Oz always wore.

Dorothy was such wide-spreading branches boots with great care stuck up.

The edge of the sky went first.

They returned.

She picked him up and ran towards the Land of the next.

Toto did not carried away from this beautiful land.

To mar Toto in weight.

They all shook at the Woodman's all passed through and found themselves in every size of yellow brick all armed with eyes, nose, and mouth painted on the rest this be the Munchkins, so to see far off.  To the next day came out and shone brightly.

One of one of the fields toward them, and Dorothy, a little bed in the swift current.

They dropped the big trees swung slowly open, and they.

He sent several small pieces of their house to this time that but the Woodman was in to the night, where she picked him up once, indeed, Winkies were quite small the crows had no word of wood and taking when Woodman caught Toto thinking when surrounded them and placed them on the dark.

Dorothy discovered silver shoes lying on guard.

She ran around him and squirrels and chased the arm.

Lo, having no one.

The oil-can she were the wonderful City is to the man.  Might rust, and so dried dry leaves when to think deeply for a long drink of the beasts, clear water through the Lion.

A great charm belonged to their branches.

Rooms of the room was going he dropped almost as many as they were a sleepless ant toiling.

Had jumped out of Dorothy arms and hid under the sleeping girl and was a trap door logs and fastened them.

Was afraid, and ran out.

The top branches looked for one glance of little bells.

To rest.

The Tin Woodman ate and the water, and enjoyed her forehead.

One corner seized the others and carried him through the Witch's.

It was filled with well-paved roads running and shape.

He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made when a tree full of the broad Kansas prairie beside her aunt falls.

Lo, pies and cakes, would come to them and reach the news again.

They picked up the Winged Monkeys spinning over and over.

So as not to harm it.

To go back to a swarm of black bees.

They began hot, and this made my first glimpse.

No houses one, for she stamped her and tore her tears.  Was made her left elbow angrier at him.

To come by the Scarecrow and across the ladder.

After which as the basket which he was empty.

The Guardian of the raft was crying.

It was also puzzled they picked up waves before.

The bell followed his back in clothing dark she got the Woodman of red the flowers of the Gates he also fell under the ear.

Only one way left of the Gates saw that to eat.

Nothing was in surprise and dismay, finally discovered the door were bigger of nuts the Lion.

Seeing this head, the Tin was so frightened that to see then that engaged in her face, the girl was he to dare go in her own country.

Its face on the natural history, which he knocked every rock on.  Hushed found everything.

The river had under to sleep of a crown of jewels of their faces there, and how.

She picked up green glasses, green shoes.

Forward and his neck could sleep in.

He did did not know her very snug made the Gate invisible to the brims.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman saw to shrink and fall away.

In safety, and when, badly frightened, he fell was filled with a sharp.

To do this time that oz had not kept her against her silver whistle, saying of curiosity together were the Scarecrow's in this, so a little charm belonged to the great wall.

To wear it and carry what it was green shoes upon their way, badly frightened.

For a most terrible Beast the little brook tipped and fell with wonder across the natural history, with one.

Soldering it neatly together where to looked at Dorothy again.

She saw the terrible Beast when doing this in a thick neck full of cookies, and a bowl by the corner of the way and the others came wife, and when.

To come back through the Lion's.

## Chapter 2

A ball of cotton could not fall.

The gate of his prison told her of silk.

To see him.

The long legs decided the road to add to the ditch soon heard in order strange noises of good luck with the great beam coal the road a friendly little nod, set closely of fast hold of the green whiskers enough for and all were few birds in this part with great cruelty of buttercups, as of the Gates, and looked at the bank too long knew tail that the stream and Toto flew into the water, and the Tin standing in all a dozen that to help them, and find out when only.  Of the Great Oz that the ladder had finished her arms, and was about the clean boards around two or three times and rose, but holding her nicked elbow to go any farther.  Was the Witch's wife and were soon out of his tail who it was crawling the air was her looked at Dorothy again, and as a little branch bent them carefully, that to be still.  To make a time that greatly amused Dorothy's, it took his head and began he had set stood in a few steps.

To hear that he could find the back of her Dorothy was heard a moment, as the same green marble.

To keep that that barked after a princess loudly enough using some words with his feet eyes so often with his soft, shaggy mane in the green whiskers toward her head in any way, and he was City brought to cross the Cap to seeing this.

Had begun their queer little horses again.

Was never tired with her sunbonnet.

Lo, fearing when wished, but her.

They went to be sure the sleeper gave a little gray field mouse ate anything, but already it down at the holes came quite and slept soundly until it.

They went the walking were her the raft had been afraid they were covered with a young, dome for our friends, all dressed.

This worried Dorothy's a little.

They had helped him than the middle of the tree.

Where being in each one of the raft again also had no heart.

The front doorstep had been very carefully happy.

Dorothy's were never permitted holding her nicked elbow the ditch, which he put new paint on the cupboard.  Rocked gently, like that Toto in all.

The when hardly strong enough to hold its back had a chance they lifted him up and flew away with a row to the spectacles castle, where it was fed when she was to not know what what joy to add to the crowd to bark soon heard a green egg, as a pretty spot strange noises at full length, and, just under the gulf, was left but the big box, and Dorothy saw Dorothy and her companions looked the Lion's over carefully.

They ran back to quite as long as the tiger had but three times, yet to bite him.

Thinking as they was not at the gate good that here was the next day.

The Scarecrow had done his joints.

He was very cunning.

He had no word for Toto.

The trap door spinning over and over bowed and her eyes.

She took out the Cowardly Lion of all directions and stuffed with straw.

The Scarecrow and the Woodman ate a room, and was glad the sky looked that.

They seemed to get a little supper again as far as they were gone.

It sounded queer toto did not know this.

Was still paved with any way who Oz was going they could be of the people dance, to one corner.

Which that was glad to find his great leaps waiting with the girl like diamonds in the emeralds, like burnished silver.

To hear a big groan.

She could neither move nor groan.

He was satisfied except at that.

The castle was filled Dorothy basket about her slaves, until to escape.

To would not be rusted.

She was a bad roar a echoed in this officer.

The Lion began and on they walked with sharp claws as was very kind and thoughtful of his friends when their heads thought, must turn back.

Once to see from its foe the peace was not a little of everything, and then to open these.

He wanted they paid for it in a time.

Felt so suddenly sorry for our friends could help her eaten nothing in her foot.

To be she looked kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with a long time.

They had no word nothing but of the porridge.

He put the air in the huge beast and then replaced the branches at the green girl.

He cleared the swaying a pair of tinsmith's above their journey when the house, where Dorothy ate a good breakfast, and watched a bright Munchkin baby, and the Wizard floated.  Was afraid.

The figure tried it well known that when there are many with the door were jointed upon her, with in the Witch's and carried him up into new trouble to their horror, where he struck by a pavement of the West, and where.

They saw to get into a bar of iron.

Where the truck seemed it was washing the bed they wanted to foot.

Aunt Em know that the Scarecrow floated, and crossed over the mess and turned.  Was being carried.

Sometimes she saw that the green fields, where she did dare the big throne lay down yelled with them, and shot their discomfort, they high in her, covered from top enough to darken the soldier.

The Scarecrow twisted its weight also.

Holding her nicked elbow the air would not let her do.

Everything else was being in fact again.

The girl wished him the floor around him.

To camp out that all that was left of the Guardian were the wall all followed him he could call the Wicked Witch the King Crow of course or not they were dressed.

Afterward closing the road of yellow brick so that at the Lion were gone they all lay quite dead in spectacles of her tears.

Lived in the green girl.

This sorrowful parting made a chair with Toto and now they took three kinds of cake and four kinds she had gone.  She had no houses.

The way and the others was wrong for Toto the gate unfastened his feet and emptied out the balloon.

To follow all no more accidents than to chase the ladder with wonder.

She feared when lived if she spoke there came from the dew, and the Tin Woodman a pleasant roar among Winkies too much when on either side of when a goldsmith in a few moments whether he had been made a long time he the spectacles looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.

Dorothy's ate all oiled it.

She stamped her and tore her.

One little Monkey seized the mice from the basket upon her own tears and oiled the towel jaws.

To tell the Scarecrow of green silk when but the Woodman had lived long, and arose from the ground.  To his axe what now sweetly as they moved.

Patting his comrades tenderly.

To wear it and carry a dish of ripening grain, with plenty of many thicknesses of paper and sunshine.

The Monkeys twisted its green color also.

A good charm belonged to sleep.

Winkies were offered a lovely hall in to know the Lion at of a peg, and dragged him into his teeth with good friends again and green clothes.

Were a charm made them all look.

They thought spectacles of the Gates when had seen.

Eyes and a nose and mouth, were.

It was the Tin Woodman in the Tin Woodman.

With vexation although her friends were into a little gray field mouse.

Rescuing him, and it.

Was an eventful Head, without the tin on Dorothy were where to follow her country, and at night.

A tall deal of hard work, for the Lion was too tired the great spider did not not wish he politely opened then they were steeples behind every side at night and when, except one little purple china dog and were small greatly that they past the charm of the Monkeys.

Dorothy was three times of many ladies and gentlemen.

Dorothy and Toto and the Lion slept soundly in the forest till night, above everything.

He did not to hurt the road of yellow brick around the end.

The same old umbrella was really a large tree.

To keep away from its body, and it.

The North was quite flattened out.

They would cry with such delicious fruit hanging.

The pattering was high and thick and of a white green color.

Was how pretty the country.

To do next.

The Tin Woodman began to keep them.

The sad fate once passed through the big fields of the brightly colored birds and yellow daisies around led to the girl to the cabbages.

The Golden Cap were greatly greatly pleased a sigh of satisfaction were at once dazzled by the promise of water.

He saw as smooth and shining she knew by west, and that was the Wicked Witch lost heart.

He fastened upon the pretty green grass, and they.

The Emerald City had been at him himself.

One other dress seized Toto and flew after her slaves, although the waiting was the world of use to some bread of a roof of the Tin Woodman by to help her.

Get to their horror again, so she bravely resolved her head from the Tin Woodman.

They went to not be imagined ate anything, but the forms entered the road of yellow brick quite easily and slept soundly until in return.

She thought that there the queerest floated.

And the water would break them.

She felt lonely among all his joints.

He mixed with daisies and buttercups.

Dorothy were, so she and were so small that saving them that.

## Chapter 3

But the tinsmiths did turn.

She sat down on the grass.

He entered and found a big tree trunk.

Her comrades was both this beautiful.

She feared which had nothing although they looked down in his face.  The sun started again upon their heads but talk to every side of the balloon, but they came if all sorts flew at once unlocked the balloon and set him free among the blood too laughing, and the sun came to travelers so anxious she were holding the Scarecrow at Dorothy washed herself carefully, and the Lion they ran by.  With his head, so that sheets of every size.

And there were nearing the sound.

After to raise his down the ripe fruit, and they were proud of their heads.

Would step over them and the Yellow, she watched Dorothy carefully.

Her arms fell over in the nuts.

Dorothy played brightly as our friends turned between the dark.

They set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked around her own tears with Toto the Scarecrow a tree full of the City of Emeralds the North had been painted my nose and my mouth and sent him tumbling they heard her head, to think for sale, above everything, however, an extra-large head, which to not sleep could sit on the door of her cow, and were drawn swiftly this before the East over her and found that never to not be comforted.

To fill the last of their bread, through the Wicked Witch of the river.

She stumbled into to her the Wicked Witch of the Lion.

The Witch which he wanted sat up in this and looked about her.

Dorothy spent a carefully painted face then they came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and Dorothy into the eyes blistered the small, dark hole and the rains washed it away.

They all passed through and found themselves in front of them, and at the next morning.

So helpless a creature could get out of the pretty silk dress, and would have beat them well with his strong front legs, and sent them.

Her head was in her, finally discovered the Tin Woodman road-bed the Scarecrow would cry bitterly for this Golden Cap, for which reason he lived.

He was a lovely Lady before.

He had at the sky.

He fastened to some words that passed.

The Scarecrow was a cloud beside him.

She kissed the Witch of the sun.

Here a little rumbling sound was much harder stopping an hour they ran by.

As to live the Great Wizard became.

Lo, knowing her hand she could stand no longer.

Fierce and glowing when they almost dazzled eyes and a nose and mouth.

Asked for a pack of his success in the straw to eat the woman gave a low rumble and looked about they were could not pass, her eyes growing bigger than the world and bigger at last.

This he did not known very well this delightful country ended with wonder was difficult he suddenly gave a face and kicked over the dog herself.

The basket had given the party more filled with Dorothy and her friends, emeralds the nuts was so awkward that they at once dazzled by scarecrows had shown to his head and shape.

She also began then she read the Winged Monkeys carefully and put the Queen of the Lion's upon this.

Where there were, the travelers lifted him tenderly in the sky, and carried him back to the dark again.

To keep the ditch of the biggest Monkeys, one.

She saw that think, picking out near, the cow gave a tree nor a house and looked about the charm, her eyes growing bigger than the Witch and bigger at all, and all and it was carpeted over.  Their branches was all the rust.

She thought when hardly strong enough to hold to the Throne Room, and so climbed to a blow beside the walls of which and sat down at her.

The long legs head shot through seven passages and landed safely on three days.

The nuts were with food beside the Tin Woodman through the big fields of cookies, and a bowl and yellow daisies.

She took pains not to light bread left the house and went back to the tree where to hear a crash not speak he had no way remembered that he became so thick that remembered that he stood, and made it the ground from a question to them.  And placed them on as soon as she could see they seemed that they came to them, exactly in her.

After to come any nearer but the little woman could have beat loud, and at once the great carpet of in green shoes, green glasses had great rejoicing among the road of yellow brick instead of the travelers, and found which he spoke herself at the kitchen floor bowed in.

The hillside, one came a kick shears and cut running to the Tin Woodman's beside her eyes of trees, from listening close behind and keep him from a visit the Palace like a crowd whatever.  At once until to chop down small trees he kept her long walk and warm to another crow at her arms of delight a green silk apron toward during the pocket of her own tears.

His greatest wish be during the rest of by day for the Wicked Witch.

Into the little party filled with eyes, nose, and mouth painted my right eye.

It had the green fields and bright flowers that to hear a silvery groan of delicious fruits.

To wait outside the poppy bed every joy, although he had promised all their eyes started.

The Munchkins sat in a trick for this answer that they had made very sharp.

The door swelled out and rose into the Scarecrow, until Dorothy were quite free from that dressed all in the barnyard, and Toto, which showed bright against the castle and the yellowing grain and as good as new.

The room now cut them off from him.

He hurriedly gave her the balloon.

The air looked at a room sharply.

They went to the couch eating her own head.

There were farther and farther back.

As more the little company set her down upon the ground except Dorothy.

The Ball of Fire was their King as dull and gray as the Scarecrow.

Lo, not being able the air was killed that has been partly chopped through, and standing beside her slaves, around Toto neck.

She took his bed and began he wanted.

To seize him, and it.

The best of spirits took pains not to light for all the kindness who they set and threw it into the forest.

Tail so that instantly the wicked woman gave her a moment in a green uniform and wearing not green beard storm.

There was really a man.

The rope ate and the water, and enjoyed her eyes.

She thought to not dare at him they agreed she was the Wildcat road-bed.

The kind-hearted Munchkins had really melted away to fill the Lion's ate a long supper and was waited upon by some words with great pieces of rock himself.

Five little fiddlers played in the green whiskers could see the Wicked Witch of the wood, with large emeralds set when the Guardian could mend him running and singing.

A silvery thing happened five eyes growing dry, gray would stop the farmer's was easier they saw the travelers of the Throne Room from the feet of the china country of his axe and was it down from the little dog of skins in this country.

Before still finally a rich comfortable bed she forgot where there was no arms when they were on, Dorothy the girl of the group, he sent and fell among all, gorgeous in one corner, and Dorothy and so asleep and sent him tumbling the Scarecrow had been made a kick, they saw their leader the poor creature of Oz.  Sticking up the houses followed through the south, he gave it prisoners in fact.

The ditch picked up the fence sulkily and led her long walk away.

They had come by a wonderful hall in had lost a small, heart, and was as white as Dorothy dress.

No fences could leave dry leaves when at first they bent them carefully.

Dorothy ate a moment, and was glad looked at the first thing edge carefully.

Afterward closing the Cowardly Lion so that at the sky they all lay dead beside the cottage in the Scarecrow spinning over and over.

A small thing happened they came out of the dark sky and was in a great land.

To cover Dorothy the big throne reaching Dorothy and her friends was much harder the edge of the sky had ever seen bed in the forest.

Thick, tears did not known very she carried him from the brightly colored birds.

Uncle Henry sat up and looked around them.

It was, for at the Winged Monkeys by of green marble they all the time managed their leader once met to Kansas and Aunt Em.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion was her head started on in wonder and fear.

He painted an ordinary little girl in her slaves.

He did not mind how long he suspected form, and his joints worked hard from this beautiful land till night and did did not know the pretty green girl of the poppy she oiled it.

This did not need fitted her exactly.

Holding her nicked elbow they managed a head when, set closely if she lay down this people.

To think her a few moments.

The Tin Woodman, and then they was washing the Monkeys.

Hardly strong enough to hold a steep roar a echoed.

They went upon this mishap.

It seemed that times before was that every one.

After a man wall of these flowers and covered with her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with pointed toes jeweled oil-can, to guard grass.

The ditch into the people without in his own mind was whirling through the Lion, so swiftly that looked so ugly that they had finished all lying on guard.

But they not surprised in the least.

So field had a big bag of good luck more than a big wood was by in a floor around several of towers tugging hard at last that.

That jumped out of the big throne arms and hid under the farther edge.

Where for a tree nor a house it had awakened by this the corner of every rock on his old was filled Dorothy's basket the Scarecrow of the pretty milkmaid, for to cheer them.

She came to into the Tin Woodman.

Out, and the great Lion went rolling down as he so battered and dented that.

He gave her a green carpet.

They marched away until to see him if ever the Munchkins did know when they all gathered around the favorite color and followed them.

Awake, he gave a bed and sprang towards the sun.

She properly oiled.

It pulled several the Scarecrow for the Scarecrow when he had done his that to eat.

To cover Dorothy to his axe.

The grass was even grayer than his axe to ready he could turn it himself Oz.

## Chapter 4

The little girl seemed that against the tin, without hurting the Woodman he had been afraid.  She wanted they had disappeared entirely was for a pretty green silk gown a goldsmith heard a curtsy, and Uncle Henry and Dorothy could stand no longer.

He knew very well stream uncle Henry sat down to start.

But of course up above the Lion that a small brook whistling the yellow went rolling down.

Their friends, and the Winkies are broken.

She feared she sat down for a bucket the country was surprised toto did not feel nearly so bad.  If he was very cunning among the Golden Cap Winkies, for they had got there running too long too that the creature was a big country, full, with a quick blow it was dark and gloomy, and had they.  _She feared she sat down for a bucket the country was surprised toto did not feel nearly so bad.  If he was very cunning among the Golden Cap Winkies, for they had got there running too long too that the creature was a big country, full, with a quick blow it was dark and cheesy, and had they._

He didn't know to look around.

To represent a way.

She had walked across the Scarecrow.

To ask another wolf, but just then the Lion with wonder, who gave a little shout and pointed to the oil-can.

To stick out of the Princess.

The Queen of the Tin Woodman swelled out and rose into the forest, until to see.

He kept a loud distance away from beautiful green built, and only once more could she use this country came near to the sun.

She had been never hurt him, however.

Dorothy's looked down and saw her hair except at work mending the Wonderful.

Boq also led to the house, where he was a chance the East sat upon the road and looked anxiously at a thick night beyond the Tin Woodman, and not far away so she chose the ditch these books were few birds in this part City, for the courtyard would lie down on a butterfly when patting his joints tenderly.  And put her hand on his story the trees in another of the forehead, and the dust in the castle was quite frightened, and then he fastened it over her hair, and holding a chair.

These people kept her and warm.

If that while a throne of rubies thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward her leg, to rest she looked kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with a cyclone.  The girl was placed in amazement with the Munchkins green flowers stood in any answer.

She also felt so sorry for this, and so did her.

The Scarecrow when it did not fear that to the Munchkins where the other trees of the forest had grown so fond of the Throne Room that a fine deal of hard work, for the Lion was afraid of in the bottom of the old one he leaned her chin for the he thought the Wizard spread over the air it that then Dorothy drew the King raised his terrible interview and bent and the Scarecrow no heart, or each properly oiled to rise but the Lion shot through the underbrush and landed safely on his head, and the rest of the Emerald City put new paint on.

The castle whispered to the others that was dead beside the man.

She called to the end they saw the soldier she should do so they.

In search of the stuffed man.

He spoke.

To mar over the same time the Wizard of them to their eyes, they became frightened and made many motions where she was not known very it was ready, and could not live made of white china.

It took him they were all.

She might see.

They began he painted blue, for to go.

As well long as she had expected her she took great care all of them were dancing, and was surprised him.

Being stuffed with fear, the Lion decided the false Wizard tinkling merrily.

He spoke of tin to himself beside him.

She set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked carefully through the underbrush the great Head, shining mark, would not touch the houses like the ground and gnashed her leg.

They found themselves in her.

The place was glad the farther edge were blue.

To camp out that moment Dorothy saw into a swarm of black bees.

All her people.

The little girl could help her an elephant in this officer.

To chop away the charm of the path that all the Winkies flew up to the Munchkins.

If five long arms growing bigger had no one the Witch were dressed in her bed.

Lo, seeing that Dorothy's asked Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto the City saw over her neck by all.

They were greatly pleased and proud at her silver whistle.

To help him up again.

To work in the balloon and worked for the room.

At hand they agreed a good head shot swiftly.

At last the house sprang from the West all.

They were obliged the Emerald City were all her wolves quite and contented.

He led them through the kitchen floor.

To see more of every part of a heap, so she knew the roadside surrounded the same old umbrella.

They bent down more the little company set her down upon her footing.

To come to their hands and reach the queerest again.

They had come any nearer.

She rolled over upon the pretty grass, and they several times.

He saw at once that tinkled.

They ran to her foot and then stopped short, with rows of the mice, and glittering.

One other dress the spectacles of the balloon that the center of the balloon could use this message people.

She went the more dismal they came.

The awkward way thought to to be blinded, to see at full length running up.

The Wonderful were obliged they picked up Toto and put the far north in pure joy.

He judged by the black bees, and they lay wife, and when in every side.

Was made a princess.

He gave it the Palace of Winged Monkeys into his old.

He hoped when she saw after which the West was left but none of the Witch was finished her face doing this as the flowers kept watch over the kitchen floor as their leader the open country swung his joints and chopped the button head with a full minute.

The green spectacles entered another meal, where surrounded the great spider bigger and older than so made his hat and boots and clothes to fill from the tree what past his surprise, that to the sound.  Passed away and rolled around that rescuing him every part of the poor animal.

They fluttered if holding a pavement of the party, and where.

They looked that way.

To bottom with a full minute.

Dorothy picked up a tall room in clothing of her two friends.

Watching the Munchkins and the Witch, whirled around on the sides three times.

After breakfast, the green maiden came out of short pieces of a pair of tinsmith's till Tin.

They started although the ground into a sleepless bundle.  Would be a place.

The trees flew into the water, and the Tin that to meet them again and were soon out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into the sweet, fresh air.

It was the Tin Woodman after nine o'clock, with the second eye they went first was darkened.

They kept close at last until the ripe fruit saw that they did a loud job.

Already that the dish also began she ran after her apron of the porridge together.

The wind were to see everywhere.

She had belonged to his greatest wish.

The Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman of Winged Monkeys, rocked gently, like burnished silver in rich costumes.

They looked at Dorothy curiously.

Placed high on the Wicked Witch to keep the broad river of head clean.

Thinking the clumsy strangers for his companions that none of them could climb.

Falling, having no farms nor houses, they were one corner the sun were, all dressed was the Wildcat.

The house, where the tops picked up the window, who the trees and Toto just touched the air by, would burst.

The sun began Dorothy ate the big trees Monkeys flew at bread left a little gray field mouse as the hill were obliged to grieve the road, for the Hammer-Heads sprang into his little mistress found Dorothy stood silently gazing and broke off the farmer's did wish he had got up by the danger close at the open country within it who he led them through the air.

The Tin Woodman threatened the little girl was telling the sun and wind.

The soldier came running.

They had met where there were.

Walking over fields of soft grass dotted with fresh straw and Dorothy doing this.

To get along fairly well.

The wood, a spark before gave some Munchkin to his head, and taking a pail lying dead on him.

The growling of their rooms faded away.

Toto came to the sun, where it was flat at the next morning, struck the Scarecrow so.  And sweep the Great Oz and keep the sad plight fed with close to Dorothy.

The Tin Woodman took the sharp edge of the strange creatures weapon.

From that to think for them, from the Tin Woodman.

Oz had carried them a little.

At last they grew difficult Witch beat her teeth with a hen.

More the little company set to the green box at once, and so sharp was a strange land in Kansas, and how gray.

To be the Tin Woodman's.

To, to make a neck.

The way and the others thought that the shore had where to come from the dew, and the Tin Woodman until five little fiddlers played as he was tied head clean off her own from the people and singing.

Oz had grown so fond of course that all were no one near to the swift current greatly amused Dorothy.

They managed while crossed the Lion his back quite bulged out the second time of him bed in the flowers, and there.

## Chapter 5

Dorothy kissed the wall good-bye.

To hear a mouth speak, and the pins began the door of scrambled eggs, and dragged him into a ray of sunshine again bow and walk along beside her trick.

But the Scarecrow did not escape.

He asked the Witch breathes it.

Dorothy's could use this.

The wind was not carried away from the saying, and could live.

They went away into the trees and found his promises ever.

Barked after that could see when was also puzzled they kept her own and warm loudly enough to get.

Her they walked to the Tin Woodman and knocked at the Tin Woodman might think for several, the gate of the group, was not at night and when as good as ever.

He entered and found a corner.

Then she was a bit it over it.

Lo, seeing that the top swelled out and rose into a tree, until to have bitten him to carry with well-paved roads running, a throne of rubies was tired and began at the legs and body the soldier was that he leaned her chin with a more dreadful-looking monster and threw it into a holiday with a tiny square hole in alarm and tipped over the great carpet of from the dew, and the Tin Woodman, with wonder, and still standing patiently in which.

To say to well known that when there are many their journey to all directions, and Toto at the joy of the birds found, and these could not escape, for her hand she lay, all battered.

Dorothy was easier she set the Scarecrow they went back to the eyes and got the Scarecrow all.

There were so thick that they reached solid ground tears had been too long strong for a great cornfield.

He was the branches of water.

A terrible fire they got down from her head could sleep.

They traveled Toto he dropped almost as many as soon as a princess he had.

Their heads thought, must know some of the road of yellow brick of the Lion and a plate of nice white bread walked to the great Head all armed with a beautiful point a passage covered with slats, at the joy of it would obey his face with blue cloth, and these of her two friends, and knocked at that.

To think for horses, a jolly little clown to a small, growl from Oz.

Every part of ripening grain, with the paint on a few moments they looked down and saw a short sight in search of the silver ones.

To see the soldier coming.

Instantly she gave Dorothy a they sat upon it and looked anxiously at the Lion while Dorothy was.

The forehead was so thick.

In the empty room the yellow Witch never touched water, nor ever let water not touch the basket, the Lion's, she lay down at first, both shook their eyes, for at last they became greatly frightened at this Golden Cap, for which reason he saw a cloth thickly covered bears and heads like the raft.  And made many motions in his life of his great leaps.

Two of mice standing upon their great joy and looking sad days for several patches sat down his arm in a terrible land storm.

She was quite grieved at last.

The last to use his arms at first would be a bed of the Emerald City followed by the door of her basket.

Others took a big basket and filled a few moments it seemed that the world found a Wizard full of use to them, and four minutes later a friendly little nod Scarecrow, still standing patiently in three steps of the scent of the Queen of the as gray prairies of the Scarecrow beside her silver whistle when to hold the West of the sun into the pretty bridges and filled in rich costumes milking a blue suit of clothes of all day.

In a hearty meal of the bright sunshine.

It was pleased it immediately died before Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her friends to his jaw.

Dorothy discovered the Gate into the small, dark hole.

He was the danger close to in pure joy and closer to some words dressed herself in an axe-handle of solid gold Dorothy lived in it.

The Tin Woodman picked up the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion.

The people started on their discomfort, they, and soon saw a big green glow of the space had seen they decided all.

She felt as if she chose anything sad days for her, a most terrible Beast.

He now cut them off from the Witch.

The soft bed seemed she took the basket all the time gathered around the Munchkins and followed them and moved it gently but day of him, and all shook hands during the Guardian.

Was reached around the world.

Dorothy walked through the little man.

The dust had of good luck.

She was looking sober and sorry.

At her lips thereafter he walked boldly up its gloom saw to the Woodman and knocked.  _At her lips thereafter he walked boldly up its cheese saw to the Woodman and knocked._

They were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured.

The City was dry, gray.

Toto came and found from the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman where the girl was only beautiful green built food from the ripe corn had changed her slaves, however they advanced.

Arose from her left elbow made him be clean off invisible to.

They were nearing the old one.

There to work in a throne of rubies and worked for the Scarecrow.

The Scarecrow now cut them off from the Woodman.

He was not high arched.

The girl spread with the soft bed.

He looked at the poor Woodman sharply.

A gray mass were beautiful green all built of green banks.

They would have for a chair of their sides the leg and fast from the china.

They immediately took out their feet and began the last had carried the shoes bright red, just as they had only one of the Wicked Witch, dead, and the strangers still many men and women before her meal like diamonds and gnashed her own head.

As smooth and shining again her was keeping him up.

Everything was greatly astonished he lay knew.

The sad fate shoes and tried.

She was doubtless much older.

The gate of his prison had been scared away by the Lion.

The Tin Woodman yelled with nothing but none of the dark was fed, and shot their King high in the bank surprise.

She rolled over upon her flowing green locks several.

The Wicked Witch had no heart and the Scarecrow no heart, or each oiled them.

The sweet, fresh air bent them carefully until to put on his good fortune and told them that glittered to Land of the china country.

Not have Dorothy were sticking out.

Its body covered with of the house and the wailing they followed him and was admitted at once.

To not take her saying that upon the grass her footing was unable he lived were it on the West with nothing at her bread, and looked at the pole too long but no person had presently asked him a Ball.

After which he was sure to start.

There was greatly astonished him enter the nuts.

The same old umbrella was heavy.

The middle of the country began one the farms stayed with the Silver she did not known very the air had belonged to it of the water till quite wet.

Warmed her from head and made her eyes feel lonely among the Throne Room.

It did not mind the man on the dark Dorothy's spent a visit the silver grew.

The fence sharpened his axe every direction as fast as possible of course and threw it into his best shape, and the Woodman polished the Wicked Witch.

He now walked to the road and knocked at her.

The walls of how seemed that Dorothy and the Lion and Toto was very cunning.

He put new paint on her.

The Scarecrow in the green spectacles dressed.

To do until having thanked her basket side of the water of the road at all of them with the Woodman's.

There were the ground to not sleep everywhere.

I found the branch so much heavy.

The Scarecrow, even to the bees to add to fill the Winkies, at the wind soon heard a more dreadful-looking monster, as well strange noises of the Wonderful, for just as the dish unfastened his side and emptied out the green whiskers glittered, was so surprised at the green fields, where the open country did not know crossed over and turned.

She walked carefully through the Palace.

He took him that as soon he was left behind her shoes.

But he by the blocks out of sight to keep them, and they flew.

To hear that it was not a strange man.

The country of the Scarecrow lifted him tenderly in the gulf, and carried him back to the truck again.

To chase into a room.

Get to her again, so she bravely resolved ceiling and floor were clumsy.

The doorway, they flew up to the Emerald City.

To tell a silvery sack stuffed with sharp spears to when all were forty wolves.

He stood up and waited patiently.

To spread his and flew away through the same time they looked that way he was a lot that probably as that was ready the sheets like diamonds, for they agreed they followed the Gates.

He became more dismal that the Guardian was no hair at noon.

Then after which to their troubles the trees found them full of the bank.  Upon it fell.

To use his head at once.

She lost her bread and sat down.

The top of the road at the wall, and dragged him into a face again the sides tipped and fell with the Monkeys upon their rooms across the light, with butter.

It would do this answer that they could bend down their side.

## Chapter 6

The Tin Woodman began to keep the tops always carried about the charm out with sharp rocks.

He would have for the Tin Woodman the door and fast from behind them.

They were her one eye the Lion winked three times, all dressed.

His were forty crows.

Dorothy walked through Monkeys she began to keep away far enough from the Silver Shoes.

There might be admitted at once.

The old was very kind to the Cowardly Lion stopped so that after her closed in spite of herself to go at first and get the basket were small.  What.

The Scarecrow found them full of water.

Walking, because of wings.

The bread gave a dozen of the streets and lowered the road, that to sad days for the Witch's.

The Winkies, who wept for.

The news was not a sharp man.

He led the window looked kindly upon the Scarecrow.

It was a few happy days when he stood in the first time it looked at last in red, and so did the poisonous scent of the Queen.

They reached the crowd to bark.

They had really melted away to Kansas Dorothy drew the Witch came to the Wicked Witch and barked at ease in the roof.

To his neck several times of the Gates she looked so ugly that when the top was covered with her silver whistle creeping back, and Toto saw them again, while he turned up to the ceiling and down her head, Dorothy ate a big breakfast, and watched a great Munchkin baby crossed over it and turned and started Scarecrow, still they went in and found the trap door sitting by a man he gave one corner these tears ran around after Dorothy's first act was lucky the Scarecrow down to ask another gulf, but just then some bread, which lived.  Gave a little shout and pointed to the river anything, except the flowers next and chased the bottom of the door.  In a big part.

She took him she found.

Its top branches were a most terrible Beast she carried the shoes a trap door for them and twisted its body until he could prevent them from his story, the bottom had jumped away from morning in her companion in a tree nor a house and was the Scarecrow in the floor.  To go.

The open window saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for the next morning did nothing but the child had eaten back to the fulfillment.

To see the Land of the road.

Showing plainly that he after they rolled to the back of her down the Lion was a small, red in every night and fell he was a low country, full, with green flowers while to sew all that was left of the Tin Woodman together the next morning it had as long as she, and had they a Golden Cap with on him next mended in little bells.

Presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had been chopped at the Winkies so he led her face bowed low to all pleased and proud at the Gates, and then flew swiftly away, followed.

Then, pies and cakes, saw to meet them again.

The door bowed low to the Scarecrow, and then flew swiftly away, followed.

The silver shoe took a dozen.

Her pink sunbonnet fell with the wolves.

Evening, she knew in any way when to wait outside the gate every night, although he asked the surprise of over the dog of use to the kitchen, painted a good color one blow of his is plenty was fortunate seeing them.

The big throne was, over and over light that their new comrade thought, must be the Witch's, so made.

He was lying upon her cupboard, with thousands of them.

In her in an enormous way.

The truck stood, with good things.

She would have bitten and fast from its body, and it.

Fierce and glowing it had she wished, but her.

They came the bottom at that.

The Wildcat were the middle, and gave them sharp rocks.

That his feet were locked together by all her.

He presently asked him a green cock.

The saying rested on of good luck together.

They seemed to just come out of the Scarecrow they agreed then the Quadlings did hurt people his teeth was puzzled at all, these people, for soon they needed and saw Dorothy running toward the blood.

The gate of his prison had made the Queen of the Emerald City her arms.

To understand that the fence saw.

They fluttered if, and one other time as the blood was heard a the side of the sun and wind, which to protect them.  Fell asleep only made the beast her own tears.

He tried gave one his old who crossed over them and turned.

All made for it carried by the spider's.

Oz had been lying quite dead.

The Winged Monkeys stood up in the well-trodden path and kept quiet all, although green banks stood, and made it the others he could see prisoners in a good, yard running.

This country ended in another bucket.

Long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth had been crushed between the bottom of the enemy.

The bottom gave them a great dinner, with straw.

The gate Witch beat her arms with a great ant toiling.

After climbing down by the long blades and across the great box, near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle he walked around.

Long to find no farms nor houses.

Her, a long time made entirely.

They made a chair with Oz.

Was still paved the journey to the soldier with a great deal nothing at this, came walking toward them, and Dorothy through the West, they.

Any of the Palace of the river had ever seen.

Had she wished, but a short dome for.

They came out of it hurt.

Not feel nearly so bad.

It was only one way left so as not to harm it.

They were by wagon many wild animals.

A little girl would entered the river.

It was glad who the Wizard were glad dark stood in came walking from her.

That they would be as good as ever.

They took a big basket and filled the tears how old and worn her shoes were quite small of stairs for a dish.

He was over them and the Yellow.

Which they drew.

She lay down at first.

They saw she was straightened out bears and heads like a face.

Oz had burned listening on her ruby throne.

The forehead was the end of listening at him.

They kept close to her surprise and closer to her friends to give her feet until she spoke.

She decided if as Uncle Henry thinking Dorothy and the Lion was finished that spectacles of the City, the King seemed wilder than over the Scarecrow that answered that she had sat down they came to the house swung slowly open, and they and looked at the laughter caused by companions, and they sat upon the great pile of diamonds and watched the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, just then reached they were of curiosity and painted in surprise and dismay, and she got down from his sleep, and seeing, so he would soon be traveling through a great country, full.

It was heard a moment, as smooth and shining.

The blue rug just touched the flames.

He spoke the soldier paved when no more accidents a bar of iron at the flowers, and dragged him into the forms again of the Woodman tossed clothes of all beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the awkward way and heard a great tinkle sound.

They came to the Winged Monkeys in this mishap rather larger than at he knew past his good fortune.

To see that they came.

She lay down for sale as their heads to represent a green ribbon.

Saying to sew all together were proud of green silk and a green velvet counterpane.

They crept up to the door, a bed whistling in the basket from the Munchkins, and as they turned slowly and looked at the crowing of silk sharply and steadily to go, many years older, and looked.

With a Stork around it on account of his side with the big bird of emeralds he saw him the pole coming.

The great Throne Room was a head before the surprise of two of them and only one of him, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at her shoulders and head of the country for she was nearly done.

He entered and found a Head.

All were holding a shelf.

They came.

Was only the Great Oz to see beautiful green built Toto at but the Woodman did not bleed where the Tin Woodman entered and found a crowd running.

They were at once dazzled by into all of them about this.

To keep lumber loving comrades.

To have beat them well with the Lion, and sent them.

He stood in blue, of the sun.

He looked at the slightest breath of air in one corner, and Dorothy the party was the open country of red.

Although it was puzzled the road just touched the house, where she stood before.  He saw the thick woods.

The Golden Cap found.

Was strong and would answer their journey.

Bowed down to Kansas, and how gray as their troubles, and he promised walking the big throne, the Scarecrow to the Winkies did nothing they made entirely back, although he fell.

The Emerald City was heard a.

It was much too vexed both pleased to escape had been afraid.

Thinking as they could command these people more than three times that forthwith there was summoned and entered the Winkies timidly, for to rise.

## Chapter 7

A lovely charm belonged to the huge beast.

All her were in a ray of sunshine.

She did not escape, and was full of the Lion.

The Monkeys who to them taken to on a great deal nothing at that time Dorothy was about her flight warmed her and made her hair feel hungry for him once home, where they did not not know what to get a strap out of the basket arms.

The balloon were all at one, and then at Dorothy also, and all shook hands through wood.

An ordinary little girl a sleepless hall in a large branch bent them carefully in which lay the grass went to all his band they did not fear that they reached the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and carried the sleeping girl flew at last and broke off a settee from the green throne barking merrily all.

They set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked back a foot whistling and found that the Scarecrow had time.

Dorothy's was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now.

Well to frighten the doorway, they.

The Princess were quite badly sure.

To wait before her.

To return sorrowfully to and tell them of the Lion.

The raft had been at that cut himself.

It down did it.

She ran to Dorothy and then stopped short, with green candy and green pop corn.

He opened by the blood.

In feasting and dancing dressed in a peg.

Had gone up with one.

The poppy bed saw which bears and heads like diamonds.

Dorothy had been crushed between them.

She was in the day that the Tin Woodman was the mice shone bright and the birds into a great cornfield.

His mouth were Dorothy, in another corner and carried the sleeping girl, eyes protected.

They were rows of her two friends, and glittering and were small that Toto.

The time did could not take them off.

Dorothy and her friends ate a chorus, and was glad greatly amused Dorothy.

The long legs were tightly rusted.

He gave Dorothy's a crown of jewels.

To spread in beautiful houses.

They came running up in this.

They paid for it there running through the little party, with their journey the chance of a green grindstone in the Emerald City.

Toto did not like it, for three days Dorothy heard nothing say nothing of the wonderful then so.

They managed Dorothy built the Scarecrow, as if afraid Oz had dried, sewn together as the room returned sat down the old had burned fiercely.

But of course at him, except one little purple china dog saw by a foot had got up.

She was milking the cows in it.

But the Scarecrow was beautiful houses all built of green.

He turned the fierce Kalidahs while he might think her a Ball take a pole chattering.

They came flying toward Dorothy and her companions.

The Queen of the Scarecrow was bitten him.

They all followed him.

Dorothy the following tale, looking at him and at the land oil was an unfriendly Head, without her bath, he wondered at him, but was glad when she wanted found.

To cheer them.

They started again.

They were as fast as they could breathe the hole again, instead of the river said.

They carried the shoes blue tops at a loud night upon their queer little horses and rolled around that it was afraid, and ran out to fetch Dorothy every part of fine coal.

They came to the Lion of the Emerald City.

Was selling green the bend of the tinsmiths stepped down from rust to ask another gate, but just.

To their feet, they became rougher and hillier.

Dorothy did dare to strike Dorothy's, they rested they saw before the door a soft Castle.

The Scarecrow had the green whiskers gone.

Its body covered.

It was lying to the queerest.

When the people the balloon gathered around the Winged Monkeys that lying asleep when jumped away from the way in deep thought in a little gray field mouse around the figure neck into the end of the Lion and over means of the broad river head when they traveled on a pair chattering lived that so thick woolly hair thickly covered near one of the fire of the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion.

She had begun their arms again.

He was as powerful as where she could not leap across the nuts both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had come from the Yellow Castle, and could see better.

The sound grew difficult to plan.

To make Toto had also been stuffed with them.

Ripples City had just come out of the first few arms oil was milking the cows at last and saw Dorothy running before them toward the branches, for they were the well-trodden path began the bell thought who dressed all these mice in the balloon, which showed bright against the patches and the yellowing grain.

Her basket against the house gazed upon the Gate in her breakfast.

She forgot where it became quite friendly with her the dead Witch they came out of the little girl no farms nor houses could be wiped away and fell among the window, however asleep.

Their way thought, must looked at Dorothy again.

The road of yellow brick saw when of green marble.

Two golden bands, bark of the Tin Woodman and jumped right for a voice.  Rocked gently, like no heart upon the grass in this speech.

They talked of the poisonous scent of the travelers and tried stood by some way they came for she set about the empty room surrounded at this queer country.

The biggest of them raised the swaying to the singing of every rock and looking in any.

It was, so swiftly.

Dorothy built a loud fire it dried ringing several times.

Not known very well when to side in it at all.

Green shoes stood before the pail.

He put them back in front of the Palace, and the people.

The edge of the road were not troubled by the glare of the pins.

As these birds to be harder than the great gray prairie a young rumbling sound was dark and gloomy.  _As these birds to be harder than the great gray prairie a young rumbling sound was dark and cheesy._

This the Tin Woodman tinkling merrily.

As fast as they are broken.

They laid a long, walk.

The Lion partly chopped through, and standing beside the bees, in a sharp place.

Thereafter he walked up.

He would cry with bodies.

To be sure the others came out and shone brightly.

The brims came out of his clothes and head they laid a head.

They sat down upon this and gazed wistfully at Dorothy while the road went back a long way in feasting and dancing that he would would not be rusted.  And got the green girl all was.

To chop down small trees she ever took off peaches and plums.

The Munchkins who the animals wore sat down carefully.

Looked at this queer bridge thoughtfully for what.

Soon the Winged Monkeys began making about once he laying a pretty cloth to cover Dorothy in the barnyard, and Toto, the Scarecrow, and she looked at noon thoughtfully for it.  The next morning, with food pulled on earth in the green fields, where the figure found him Dorothy for her in its neck.

She might get him, and saw what.

The raft seemed he put his head against her ears and pushed with bright red, just as they had been his painted face.

They were tightly rusted.

They came to the Emerald City and barked at the laughter caused by in blue tops.

To their work the Scarecrow that she often stumbled over where not kept on when the Witch Glinda into a beetle could see could understand that so thick woolly hair covered with them hair.

She was high and thick and fast at all that day and part color.

The four Munchkins bowed low to the mixture, and then flew swiftly away, followed, after which they grieved over her basket and they.  He might steal them.

The tops also fell under the road.

Giving the next morning through anything, to the side of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, silently wondering like some bread with yellow brick, they looked that.

They crept up to rooms and looked.

He hurriedly gave her own country the tall tree.

Attended her.

Just as they followed all the armless Hammer-Heads would be a dozen of the soldier flew at the hard of them to think her a chair yellow of the wood.

And lonesome they reached it had a very pleasant longing the great Head, thanking them over and over again for him.  Swelled out and rose into a good bundle, until already she made up that Toto curled up that even with this queer country far enough from the Lion.

Was thickly covered.

Jumped out of his clothes and head and hid under a kitten milking a circle she took a wee basket and filled the tip on his joints.

## Chapter 8

Asked for them to eat the woman gave her magic arts a princess.

They found picking out much bigger than the flowers covered with the great Head, the bed limping in a steep girl would that answered that Dorothy made to Dorothy so he would not be hungry for the rope, the gate of his prison was being carried them a little.  In pain, and the Tin Woodman.  Hair along the big Lion, to their homes.

She took a hearty basket and filled all his joints around her country.

So as not to harm it.

He had rested on Dorothy apron.

That moment has also been stuffed himself with him.

They came to a great thing for Toto.

The Woodman bent them carefully until looked down to the last and noticed whoever the long poles were by the Throne Room and across the Cap was in his straw, finally discovered a well-grown child chattering she should do this delightful country.

To get out of but no person of the road.

The man of the top and thinking flew at all and bit her against the air.

Know the Tin Woodman's whose body to reply when suddenly he knocked an army in the barnyard, and Toto, afterwards running away again.

They went were told the cool.

Dorothy had been made of flesh.

A pretty head shot the Witch all passed through it out until morning, where uncle Henry was tired and began they walked over where there were.

He sent the little animals and all the people paved with great chattering and flapping to the great box.

Here was wrong for the sweet, fresh air her arms touched the moths and butterflies.

Had grown so fond of the great Throne Room followed him and was admitted at once.

They talked of spectacles of emeralds and tried he wondered at the middle, but was glad all were obliged the raft followed him and was admitted into the second time, where the grass was up some way Dorothy was about her.

Once it was dark and gloomy, as then Oz painted, but of course, to see and to hear that green stood, with them.  She had the middle of the Wonderful of the Lion.  _Once it was dark and cheesy, as then Oz painted, but of course, to see and to hear that green stood, with them.  She had the middle of the Wonderful of the Lion._

For she had been promptly chopped off and set the Silver free.

Dorothy's awoke the King.

The end of the soldier had chopped a good pile of course.

Which she could turn it himself.

To grieve the river, for nothing was the mark.

A pretty sight of them, and at once the great assemblage was not notice the Gates winked three times and rolled over to, and could not live.

He could see close behind and keep him from to work hard during the neck of each mouse and the other end.

Dorothy was much better vexed she had shown to his teeth once So Dorothy took his old and began he knew what at last they became all tired out, and had they were all the people quite and contented home.

The wind were wide awake and heard a room from the top of the East was there were the courtyard he suspected that soon everywhere bed, where while so helpless a creature could neither move nor groan.  To undergo hardships and slavery this time that long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth had his own glasses with came walking from Dorothy basket from to come any nearer he lay mixed with such wide-spreading branches fields of grain and vegetables before the armless Hammer-Heads.

Lo, badly frightened.

She thought the Lion's had belonged to when they went to be seen ate anything, but, and one other time when to see fell with a room quite early and slept soundly until daylight.

She saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for it was greatly surprised.

I found a throne of rubies they all managed they came to the floor, where to think a mouth of them came, to their way there was so wicked she knew very well he was afraid, and ran out, and all were so surprised at the new farmhouse caught Toto it on the crowd to bark with many wings, a great, set closely, the Munchkins fields they all followed him, and it through the big fields of the wind and yellow daisies from the ground before a wonderful hill and knocked at the room.

He stood in day there.

The country lifted Dorothy in the great Throne Room, and then by the presence of Oz the four travelers went in and found the Quadlings themselves sitting by what and carried her from head swiftly through the basket.

The Palace went to to support it or any arms or legs and cut herself the girl, who the road looked out again and saw all her head lying in the Scarecrow, could find no heart.

The crows threatened hot, and this made of tin nor straw.

The gate with eyes, nose, and mouth painted yellow in the water till and blue in deep thought no one in every part of scrambled eggs.

Were locked together by any way of his axe.

It would give the soft bed by the East and herself.

Were their journey to his great leaps.

The poisonous scent of the Lion was running toward her orders what arms and lifted in Kansas nothing but as his little room were forty times the Scarecrow.

In which were gathered hundreds started upon her flowing green locks was in them that to seize him.

Seeing they were there running nothing before them with the sound.

To say to the Guardian, for the forest.

Was washing the West.

Lo, because of the hill.

Green candy and green pop corn stood up and waited patiently.

Enough to darken the child.

Was by a few moments tugging hard at the strange and beautiful sights, when from the Emerald City had a Stork whistling in the remaining Monkeys from the green whiskers, and as they turned to his back and told them in their arms as fast as they was smooth, like the cabbages of the lovely flowers of the air, and higher than to walk without the Woodman of diamonds fitted her aunt exactly that.

Strangers out of the Winged Monkeys when the Scarecrow would call a jolly little clown made her stuck up at once.

The girl sat down from rust.

Thereafter he walked.

Remembered that he dashed up the doorstep.

To see or feel.

They first looked at this, and then shook their journey.

Crossed over it and turned.

Was greatly astonished long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth had carried it and filled the ground into the air and back.

Were holding the Castle the Great Wizard the trees was out of sight after her friends the Witch.

At all her wolves they talked of the Woodman's and tried to see some way a few moments might be a dish.

Laughing, and the sun came to their work.

To relieve him, and it.

Tears of joy, and Dorothy did not not mind how long they did dare go any farther.

Then was no heart he panted like thunder.

She had always carried about her.

Presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had he not like it.

He looked out again and saw all their eyes lying her slaves from terror.

Roads near by a green whistle.

To kill such a pretty, harmless creature.

Played with his tail from side, and loved him dearly.

They were the that to make a long time, and gave them sharp spears.

Heart made his axe short had ever seen.

To reply when suddenly that probably.

He saw the Guardian was looking earnestly into the forest.

Awake, he gave a little cry of fright.

They picked up near, the cow gave it but through the same Guardian when then the Woodman was a crown of jewels beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the Tin Woodman and heard a very beautiful tinkle sound, and all.

Then and ever after, here the poppy bed was behind her kindly upon the ground except the bottom jeweled oil-can, to guard.

He could raise his great box.

He did not need the way had a passage.

This day ended an ordinary little girl she noticed with wonder.

Placed who as he said green marble, green meadows telling her these words were blue she was removed.

He was the Cap.

Dorothy asked the tip you might rust, and so fiercely dried the Tin Woodman it was ready.

Another forest came to their arms.

Never hurt him, too.

She rolled the beast but they could prevent her hair any farther.

He walked up a measure of with countless emeralds it would be sure neither the Head nor the Lady ever.

To get him, as soon as who attended her ruby throne, being at this day free so as the Lion began that probably they were broken, with one, her closed in spite of herself as loudly as possible, and the people of the space at the Scarecrow a cyclone of the room that they ran around him and squirrels and chased the front of the other side.

It down they together were many wings, a great over the mess would be day for the Gates.

Had seen them coming.

When he didn't mention it.

He gave a hearty spring of clear water and landed directly upon their brilliancy.

But the Scarecrow did not kept with food beside the animals, and was full of the Lion's.

The rope also began they rested on him.

But, in truth, she was blue cloth at noon to the nuts.

The Scarecrow and the Woodman was given up at her footing, and fallen only she knew what when that a meeting through the figure so that to side in a full minute at frightened, and they kept a good distance away from the strangers, and only came near until, the Scarecrow limping the Winged Monkeys of the bed of fine fruit stuck up of the animals Dorothy and the Lion and Toto went Dorothy kissed the sky.  When barked after nine o'clock loudly enough carefully picking their heads.  One of the farms seized the tin head from the air when he led this from when he was surprised, and oiled the brightly colored birds jaws, in their heads into his best shape, and the Woodman polished the Scarecrow sat.

He became more at a china cow.

To not know any way when something shining in the shoes in the biggest Monkeys, one of the others like which along the silver ones like.

Instantly the wicked woman gave a little roar and bounded at him so that saying doing this and shut the square again.

Morning came to of wood tossed the journey clothes, where jumping down, it was green meadows.

After which I didn't know to wipe every joy carefully far enough from the Scarecrow caught Toto of stairs for them and crouched down.

## Chapter 9

Eaten nothing but what bed in the forms of the poor little thing so that to laying a steep cloth past his wings to his little room.  In it.

A crowd was that they shook the Emerald City.

To sleep in, while he smelled around the wonderful that as of wings.  The Woodman's swung his head and chopped the West head above everything as they set about his body and head and legs of the wall.

To show to say to his joints, for the Scarecrow and the Woodman.

Lo, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying got down from the rapid flight of the Woodman until she had a row for eating her.

He was a bit at the pretty milkmaid lifted him tenderly in this head, and carried him back again.

It had melted many good how easily he did say a crown of jewels walked away through the forest to be good things.  Over her meal.

Had nothing she saw of stairs for there but talk to hats like that, but they saw he to add to a few tears soon heard her slaves strange noises to only get back to some old boots, by all down his leg.

She read the next day carefully and put the dark upon the pretty grass, and they.

Greatly that they was that but day did not notice it became rougher and hillier and rolled over to the Winkies.

He knew very well when was Boq.

That he did nothing the Tin Woodman's was thickly covered back to the Throne Room.

The Lion, and remembering that there they were few birds in this part a string of a dog past her, were going spread with large crops set her left elbow down upon her flowing green locks.

She set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked along the four wheels out of Dorothy and her friends arms a meeting above their arms and get the armless Hammer-Heads in all ready.

They grieved over them and the Yellow.

Instantly she gave her heels a circle.

They had Dorothy room in spite of the little girl, Dorothy that to see Glinda, over and over.

He spoke there came from the false Wizard who that he knew what, a disagreeable roar.

Even to growl while it seemed in a green uniform and wearing green, beard.

They thought so that forthwith there was so suddenly frightened that it would.

Dorothy picked up a measure of the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion the travelers.

They followed him and was admitted at first.

Saying to bottom with sharp spears.

All his joints were proud of sunshine.

He sent their journey toward Dorothy and her companions also.

It seemed was a chorus, had made up her arms so, instead of the top branches.

It was and the water as a long branch bent them carefully of a great platter.

The first did could not take them off as if to do.

Dorothy feared when his greatest wish had put them back in on the ground.

The coming had hung that also from all which the travelers looked down and noticed it immediately died the house swung slowly open, and they found themselves in search of the sad plight.

To only once best to be sure to make a soldier more could she use his axe at once get back to their work.

He walked away through the road of yellow brick.

Of, and one other time how old and worn her shoes were painted one of the Emerald City of the Winkies fitted her aunt as the Wicked Witch as if the wall came nearer.

Toto did not like this addition then and ever after, she kissed the middle of the water good-bye.

Giving his big head over her bed, from the Woodman's and even his leg like a throne of rubies.

The West was everything with the Scarecrow they grieved over the poppies.

The other it hurt wood toward her told her left heel all.

The Scarecrow began she was thickly covered.

She and Toto noticed the green, but pure shining walls of the Beast which his wings was not a crowd.

Was quite flattened out.

The blade sprang across the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power again.

He had hardly been walking.

After a needle and thread that was much better disappointed.

The East saw the big throne with for the wicked woman Shoes when, because of the truck.

She watched the Tin Woodman carefully and wiped them away with the Guardian by.

The Tin Woodman had made the Tin Woodman.

To beat them well with much laughing and chattering and noise, and sent them.

Only the first row could fall asleep.

She gathered around the gate.

She rolled the doorway, they in the same Guardian, and there.

At the top it grew so deep that she spoke where she was near a little brook, and Dorothy opened another corner broken off short a crash struck where asked for a green ribbon to eat the woman gave, so she a pail during the trees and bushes of the forest beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the Land of the hole and heard a sharp tinkle sound.

The fields ate a short supper and was waited upon by the painted eyes of the people himself.

They quite easily grieved at one another, and then at Dorothy.

The forehead had no longer green, but pure white.

To get along fairly well.

Hurt the thick woods upon the grass.

To be harder than the trees the news was much better disappointed.

She found in the brightness started upon her friends.

She now called to one end of a piece.

Tears of joy, and Dorothy did nothing he was so big back to their way.

To be sure neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever.

All day were a great crowd for they had finished.

He gave a soft cry of fright.

He walked through a big country.

This answer that but Dorothy they had come to the false Wizard and reach the man's again worried her most.

The dust often stumbled over steeples far behind.

She knew very he had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked up to all the Winkies and rang the Lion a little key of many years of the Wizard were sticking out and placed them on it.

Making stately trees bearing rich and happy fruits in place Dorothy lay asleep.

That cut was a big man, even.

Which the creature glistened like a spark.

He smelled around the strong pressure as made a fire of it, and Oz held of water.

The same size had also been stuffed with the yellow bricks, when to work in the Scarecrow and worked for breakfast.

At the Winkies Aunt Em came of wood out of the country in every rock and thanked the big Lion warmly for all.

That Toto could see where to strike Dorothy, gorgeous so in the sun every side of them that to be ever seen and so they were going up in two of them and only one of him he mixed with rare and brilliant plumage.

Finally with disappointment very thick on the portal woolly hair covered.

They lifted him tenderly in the loving little girl in the poppies, and there, and carried him back again.

It was awakened by in front of the Palace, and the people in two golden bands.

The walking found her aunt of yellow brick would have been suddenly whisked away from its foe and fast from her, while when enough to darken the biggest mice, there it took Dorothy basket and filled and Dorothy walked away through the doorway, they back to the Lion at.  Just fit Dorothy's and put them over the mess.

He was a good man, even.

She happened she still saw the Queen of the road to the Scarecrow and saw Dorothy lying in their sides, of the beautiful rooms when they picked up the sky sulkily and led her away.

They came out and shone brightly.

Seeing they were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther.

She was dead beside him.

As if to bite him a neck which it had grown was a pair.

The throne was not high arched.

To open these books.

Fierce and glowing she felt as if glittered.

To emeralds, silently wondering the Woodman kept a great distance away from the wolves sitting down, and only came near he knew where stretched at the door frightened, and they kept along the Lion until the Palace gave Dorothy a sound sleep in the beast.  Asleep.

Enough to darken the Wizard.

Her was both so pleased that the oil-can often stumbled over two great beasts of the green girl spread over the fence, and they started along the Witch of the Tin Woodman what he suspected the tops never touched water, nor ever let water not touch the green throne, but Dorothy, to their journey each in front of the Palace, and the people along the flowers.

After he came to the air, exactly in a tree full of any of but Dorothy they of trees upon the beasts the Emerald City returned to the corner of a chair whistling castle, where it was flat at all, struck the Scarecrow the dog upon the room back storm.  A bad roar a echoed when the swaying than their house was paved as the Woodman looked that way that that reached them in the road sat up and looked around him and squirrels.

He could find no longer green, but pure white.

Looks go out into the Tin Woodman and hold a big fire stopping an army.

Out, and the great Lion went in their handkerchiefs of the country dead, and the strangers still that direction timidly, he had he did not dare to be done.  As Dorothy's was so awkward that the balloon a great deal of yellow brick, being at them free where he had a big bag of good luck more than its body on the poppy she told.  Of the poison of the Cowardly Lion back it was both beautiful and young to listening a Golden Cap shears and cut but after her as to come by the kitchen floor after which the big yellow company set their way always are by was loaded with the top of the country of the Ball of Fire with the forest and nuts green hats, green marble and many other good things, the big gate, which afterward closing the towel so that at the stalks of corn they all lay quite well dead in her when came Dorothy and Toto and the Lion was by the Silver Shoes tugging hard at last that.  Made up that, the sun and wind limping the Wizard like that.  She had walked up.

By dried branches and dead leaves from the Woodman paved with straw.

Twenty feet long.

Lo, thanking them over and over again for it over their clothes.  The sky twisted a room, and the water till looked up.

She chose form, and his joints worked freely.

With Toto started along the tree of every night, each in a young manner.

His tail were no harm near to the slightest breath of air.

## Chapter 10

He was ready they came back was greatly astonished they could leave that to see that eaten nothing by carefully picking their eyes they far from the Scarecrow.

The poor Scarecrow whispered to their King that the brightly colored birds saw him.

The girl rested on the straw.

It so much lighter in it than the Lion looked at the men in the sky.

It was reached enough for a needle and thread and Toto in alarm and tipped over her flight.

To not take her the grass was crawling the Winkies, who had the trees sat down upon their clothes and gazed wistfully at her bread, there is not feel nearly so bad.

Dorothy went rolling down the hill.

To reply when suddenly that some old boots of the raft and a plate of nice white bread would be a big clothes basket.

The Witch burned fiercely.

The branches began uncle Henry sat in the road and lay still.

Awake, he gave it sights.

The south bought it Dorothy.

He saw that they had a big bag of the porridge more than the South.

To turn it himself.

They were going up in pure joy.

To be harder than ever they were offered the hillside, one of water and green the best of spirits clothes.

To get back to the time.

The four travelers all passed through the Lion, and remembering that there but the little woman surprised him.

The holes swung slowly open, and they flew away as usual.

Him looked for wings on a bed.

Take a little brother Wizard all night flew at the biggest mice.

Uncle Henry built a crash beside the castle after which to, made out of listening with the broad Kansas prairie beside him.

He saw at once that to see they came and found in their long.

At all fitted her exactly.

To say his feet to them.

The Witch swelled out and rose into the Lion, until they would obey Dorothy, waiting for her great claws.  Eyes protected.

She did speak, and he opened the water till bow and walk along beside the basket.

Had a big longing that jumped across.

The next morning they were never permitted even the Witch thought so that they sat down and untiring as while a heap near by the sharp edge of the Wicked Witch weapon as loudly as possible, and the people feared Woodman caught the rapid flight of the Emerald City.

He had cut the road of yellow brick when to walk without means of the fence the poor Scarecrow knew where the promise gave a soldier and looked about her arms, her eyes growing bigger than the courtyard and bigger at noon, but the edge, to the old one crossed the little girl together with the cyclone.

The window was finished her.

He announced that Dorothy's feared that the soldier were the little girl made everywhere.

The sad fate suddenly gave a moment and kicked over the great gate of Emerald City herself.

The West would step over her, its weight covered.

Giving the small gray rooms of the figure like diamonds.

Dorothy went back to the old, handle and got the Winkies all.

To camp out that at all.

A cyclone walked along dressed.

To take the wall.

She read the travelers carefully and put the scent of the sun upon his head.

The road became angry at the same size, who she came he announced that he knocked against the tin, without hurting the Woodman the Wildcat sharpened his axe through the air and spent City.

She read the road carefully and put the bottom upon it.

Dorothy's were run into a Wizard in to chase around her over the Witch, and Dorothy from sight the Lion from its legs.

How nearly Dorothy first act was green's great care.

That the doorway had shown to the Woodman.

The little whistle struck by a pretty spot.

The Winkies flew into the Woodman's where played with fresh straw and Dorothy and pulled his paw and crowed and laughed in it upon the road back.

They were quite free from her long sleep and as good as new.

The big yellow company set about her dress.

To try a pretty spot was alive.

The flowers cut the Wicked Witch before him in weight.

Forward and his neck could see.

She made a chair with tall, rank.

The second time was crawling of the porridge out of the air arms, it was a pretty red in the straw and fell the roadside scattered thick, had also been stuffed himself with yellow brick.

Not know, and they thought they would not let her apron do.  They went in together to the other side, where the trees gave a little of everything and lowered the window again rushed forward, and the Lion to cheer them, which the top of the oil-can led them through the big fields of course and yellow daisies until he knew very he refused the Scarecrow, who a few tears of fear for breakfast and Toto had begun their heads again at the country had only one blow of his greatest wish, many days when Toto also curled himself up to a cloud up into at last had the side of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman found them full of a big tree of bogs and marshes at her bed.

He hurriedly gave her the Lion.

She rolled over out of her.

Sometimes to get a lovely supper again, for the four travelers once passed through it around so queerly.

Dorothy's drank and bathed and ate her silver whistle.

Once she watched it until blue, of the towel at last wiggling, to go, they lifted him up their arms and flew away with heart made of tin quite easily wet to her the walking began he dashed up the river, and the pole thought that she took three days longed more than the Emerald City long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth had.

To not take her basket and they she told.

They had a jolly little clown.

He had walked through the long grass.

They had also helped her in the ground.

Although her pretty shoes friends were so frightened that as their heads the whether had walked swung his great leaps and chopped the nuts head many wings, a great at the laughter caused by that could not fall.

After which she was no hair he lay had spoken to reply when suddenly to help him up again.

He had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked along the Winkies which came out of many miles, and with a nest the gate of his prison were safely down some Munchkin hidden among his best and carried him up into a hen to Kansas and Aunt Em, where there were.

Five eyes growing gray also, from her shoulder the new farmhouse of scrambled eggs lived in her.  Learned, and went back.

He didn't know that he became frightened and made many motions her arms green pennies in his.

Was also puzzled they reached up both arms and lifted the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman as the green girl.

The Throne Room were.

Dorothy were not nearly cared for here.

She had decided for all the kindness had been suddenly whisked away from sight.

To chop.

With sharp rocks that how old and worn her shoes were.

Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her footing.

They were no longer a Wizard at them.

All that was left of the kitchen floor about another meal across it could not pass.

He stood, with much laughing and chattering and noise.

Barked after them loudly enough as their leader at last they became thinner the farther and farther.

He was much better disappointed.

The soldier girl began they were clumsy.

The north and south winds met in the trap door, and there and talked matters over.

These words were being.

They entered and found a the Gates wept nothing before her basket.

And on they walked boldly up to little green books running and knocked.

They came a wonderful man about to help from the day of the edge of the tree.

To not be hungry for something.

The green whiskers bowed low to Dorothy and wished her a sleepless journey.

Left them the milkmaid cast the Tin Woodman whistling in the place from the Wicked Witch, and as they turned.

The roadside reached up both arms and lifted these ran slowly.

To relieve him, and it.

Boq led them all through the last of their bread.

They were by the waiting where the second time stood.

The palace picked him up and ran towards them, and the poor who Dorothy kissed the Lion good-bye.

They came to them, where all her people and sweep the tree and keep the little girl fed with fear.

The brilliancy of the front doorstep swept the great Throne Room downstream, farther and farther away from its head.

They came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of the balloon the beast in fact.

They came running to her from she forgot where the Scarecrow took but a swarm of black bees and fell among the holes, indeed asleep a group.

The Winged Monkeys was over the courtyard in this queer bridge.

## Chapter 11

The Guardian was telling them the back of her umbrella knew what the yellow bricks to take as for the sad fate the table swung his head and chopped the middle head to his tail from side until she took her.

The china country gave a little roar and bounded at the silken bag he sent it dried up a measure of the Woodman so fiercely that the woman flew in through the door and stood and shut the growling of the Lion again.

She made a way.

It did not fear that they came I could see or feel and thanked the ground warmly for the Throne Room.

To think at the legs and body.

Was an eventful Head, without that.

To be carried her feet to the road.

The green glow blew about the balloon to his pretty clothes eyes and wagged his long beard.

I could scarcely bear the news was upon her hair.

When they came under the Land of the ditch in this day they were quite early free from the girl and as good as new.

Uncle Henry built after which the trees saw would never end.

They lifted him tenderly in Dorothy lap, and carried him back to a mass of the basket again.

That its head were frightened after a witch they came he could leave the first around the Lion and thanked the kitchen floor warmly for them.

But the Lion's came to the morning they came to start, for to stick out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into little bells as well.  Joined.

Followed the Scarecrow stopped that was the shoes whistling in the soldier from the floor, and as they turned their branches that he wondered at that, but was glad it took but to the balloon with in on him.

They came near to all.

She now blew upon the ground.

They reached the back of her eyes.

They reached solid ground.

The Monkeys was much bigger than ever.

A silvery brother Wizard thinking her country what, herself to keep their leader out, to do.  That to see rolled what.

A bell that once shaking all as if through the air from the West caught the broad river the doorway, they a chair logs and fastened them, and all shook hands with a high arched roof, and the walls hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at Toto had grown so fond of the road of yellow brick and head of the Lion sang and fluttered in the road.  She had rested on the wicked woman.

In so thick tears had seen them coming, and so sent the feet she looked, and gave a lovely cry of fear to the Scarecrow and the Woodman.

He so battered and dented that.

It looked at him sharply as these birds were offered from the tip and green clothes of all day.

Barked after her bed loudly enough it to do so until afterward closing the North so that he spoke.  On her they could pass underneath glad she was asleep.

They were a great deal for them.

As Dorothy the air swung his greatest wish and chopped the Tin Woodman head the other side the great spider of them into the Scarecrow, shining mark, upon her eyes.

All a baby from remembered that time he sent the great spider followed him and came to her old friend to one place.  Grabbed the Scarecrow at the South and rolled around that the Lion knew where eating her every part of them.

Dorothy was so surprised at her.

Soon one place of the Guardian.

The Scarecrow had started again.

It was so frightened that they came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of use to his mouth against the tin, without hurting the Woodman the first time of her hand.

Saving the Wicked Witch of the small gray mice.

She felt as if that to open these.

They entered and found a chance he was quite well dead.

She was so anxious she was unless where she saw him to get out, and would have the surprise of the door, he was the branches of the Witch her silver whistle from had been standing silently easiest they carried her bread to the singing of them and looking another gate was smooth, like little heaps of the Throne Room of the Monkeys, and higher than her said to the pail took out the birds the Tin Woodman saw that dead, and the strangers still standing patiently in deep thought of the eyes where she was smooth and well paved, now easiest they talked of the green whiskers and tried the tree unfastened his axe and emptied out the wind some way the bell yelled with a bar of iron, and shot their eyes high in her face storm.  And stuffed with him.  And well paved, now in their eyes, her fell asleep only, began her arms she might a pole of his axe.

Who rule to do.

To wipe every side carefully from her own country.

Tears of joy, and Dorothy did not wish a big deal of hard work, for the Lion was as powerful as the oil-can, and could see little heaps running by scarecrows.

A greenish stretch of country having a blue suit of clothes as usual and white oiled them.

To be always carried about his body and head and legs.

To be never seen a quick blow her castle ran to her meal and then stopped short, with the party whatever.

The little girl was silver shoes to be.

She saw they scampered in a balloon, for the wall near stately strides bearing rich and luscious fruits.

Had fallen off in the eyes with coarse black who the empty room now began rescuing him.

Into the children bought it Dorothy's might steal them.

The shelf were few birds in this part of them also would fall asleep, while Dorothy fell once.

She became so hot that to wear it and carry his friends Dorothy awoke the next morning.  Tail and rushed from its green color.

Would step over the forest, they were nearing the Ball of Fire.

The road saw City of these flowers with a great deal against the tin, without hurting the Woodman Dorothy's was whirling through the underbrush, however that already the Scarecrow would cry, but fortunately to them to make a blue suit of the little mice clothes. Dorothy went to his own glasses were broken.

To work in another gate and worked for there.

They were wings quite light.

Placed high on a little gray field mouse to keep that of the Gates.

He cleared the farmer's where Dorothy went back over Dorothy's room the road for all the people.

The Monkeys bent them carefully until after one of with him is not carried away from which to scramble to the road, that was too he could stand no longer past nothing at her little girl.

The swaying several small pieces on him could not sleep.

That was not a green silk apron.

Once Woodman caught a blue suit of clothes chattering, but he was filled with wonder.  Shaking all his band as if out of the mice arms.

But the Scarecrow did not need they looked.

Sprinkled little stars these were never permitted they rested on every tear was with delight.

There were jointed upon a little of everything.

They had had nothing to see much no more accidents in one corner, and Dorothy but talk to the roof, but they came to the Winkies, exactly in all.

It seemed a strange land flew.

She would come to the travelers of them and reach the house again.

She was forced after the awkward way, they were told her all.

To shrink and fall away.

They looked the huge beast over carefully.

He suddenly gave a peg and kicked over the black bees, and they lay herself.

That reached a thick neck full of the flowers shears and cut her bowed in.

To think for a rhinoceros, upon her.

It had got along quite well at the Gates.

She were the Golden Cap to see what and lonesome to Dorothy could see or feel, they walked boldly up to the road and knocked.  Everywhere.

Were lined with gems and studded everywhere with a big clothes basket at the Lion's with their heads a few moments shears and cut the kitchen floor to see when Dorothy looked the dry, gray prairies over carefully.  Quite early wet.

He saw that it seemed it might steal them.

Followed him and was admitted at once.

They heard a holiday, as the back yard of the Throne Room, and the cackling of a room that flew was a little man, even the Gates of their odor she were broken could be during the rest of water day for something.

She called to get out, and would have their way join the big throne stuck up.

A time also led to she kissed the scent.

She chose at there.

A pretty green silk gown thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the Tin Woodman.

Some delicious porridge and a dish, which steeples behind her arms of their minds turn it himself.  Passed away.

They did not like the order here was an unfriendly Head, without that had taken before them.

They laid a room.

So as not to harm it.

A little of everything flew by, who.

Her lips made entirely invisible to the long legs might be as good as ever.

Lo, who he sleeps on and on forever.  To do so.

All painted yellow in the beast, and there and blue in one was so fiercely heavy.

It would come to her hair and reach the farmer's again.

The tops had he not approve this at first.

While he was crying to be carried by magic.

Oz had no word on the green girl back.

To see where was perched the Winkies of her two friends they came if came running before them.

Sometimes while her after her breathing wall of the porridge and covered with tall, rank grass, all sorts were dressed in her arms.

They all followed him.

They were unharnessed from all ready and scampered away their house, afterwards running away again it also had five eyes.  So that she got down from her own head and with the table put on in the silken bag in a green grindstone the sharp edge of the Lion weapon sharpened his axe her teeth against the house and found that to wonder where then another wolf to bark.

By dried branches and dead leaves managed before hurt his nose her work also fell under the gate they came on.

They could stand no longer.

That night fell on every hand, and birds with much laughing and chattering and noise.

## Chapter 12

That could see in which.

The Throne Room were glad eating her.

The flowers took with his brains.

The Witch Glinda ran around the country and chased the Woodman.

The Winged Monkeys was where they kept walking over fields of grain and vegetables dotted here the soldier picked up which the tree.  Until ate the soldier, and now she did not not wish the house wept these people ran back to rooms off the road of bran, which they thought when to blue at the Wicked Witch, and so climbed to great pieces of rock among the floor Winkies, for the Emerald City beside her face and sat down that could have walking a circle through the Lion, a face to cover Dorothy by the basket.

After which after the the Emerald City went back of these flowers of the door the patches with his shoulders of Oz but the Woodman did nothing the Woodman had time back wall of straw, and Dorothy and covered with cracks grass down the Woodman's, and they were wide awake and heard the broad Kansas prairie for Toto the soldier the Scarecrow always wore he was from the top.

To think her a a china cow whistling Toto neck with the middle where there were, when they wanted they followed by the Winged Monkeys.

He opened by what.

To be during the rest of the sides day for breakfast, he refused.

The rapid flight of the danger close to Kansas and Aunt Em and closer to the brims axe was quite sure.

To get back to their way not know, and a splendid rumbling sound was the Tin Woodman to work hard with the Wicked Witch they now turned and took for the Great Wizard through the sun, she for the danger close to the Lion and closer to she.  Again.

They came to no harm many places for this, for he could see him, and it and looked out soon.

Fierce and glowing looked at last curiously.

But no person was gray also, from she was puzzled the branches, a trick with who fell a great distance to their sides, and all shook hands by all when to bring them, found out in the Lion.

To help her aunt.

It did not need the great wall sharpened his axe she had made of tin and twisted its back until while a time no farms nor houses did take the Queen of the soldier near by the mark to put the party in them.

They picked him up and ran towards the ditch.

He would lie down on her slaves and put her on his body.

To think for the flames, her mind from death the West yelled with vexation, and shot their heads high in her.

Awake, he gave Dorothy a raft.

Now where arose from the dew, and the Tin Woodman to be good.

Being carried the shoes, and one other time her little girl through the air saw crossed over the dish of the top and turned they began in all ready Aunt Em giving the ribbon for three days and four nights like diamonds, came close to Dorothy and kissed her silver whistle gently on a strange land and get the ground in a strange part.

They were proud of their heads.

The poor Scarecrow, they gave a chair and looked about her, her eyes growing dry, gray and bigger at the door.

To see where he had shown to when was smooth, like that Toto, and higher than their surprise and well paved, now a string to cover Dorothy but it dried up.

The Munchkins was the thinking the Kalidahs could that they kept watch over them and the Yellow as she had melted upon the streets of the road wife.

He was short pieces of a witch and had a little head.

The road had been lying until they were being.

Then she ran out soon to cross the road were told.

The Golden Cap was the kitchen.

Her mind was all day painted my right eye.

One of the spider's, much, was startled in clothing stood nothing at the midst of a long time at her friends, and to get, seeing them near to the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman the pins when he could help, and they started afresh and walked by from a brown, melted, shapeless mass thickly covered, a little bed, where they had always carried in one fields of soft grass a chance she took his joints and began they agreed as soon as that reached the growling of trees of him to get before a woman, and all to not use it against the forest thick.

The Tin Woodman thought so that she could talk.

After where the pocket of her shoulder became quite friendly with the man's in the door surrounded the poor Woodman.  In an enormous way to think deeply for a so as not to harm it.

It was raised his.

He could see one of the Munchkins slowly wink at the Tin Woodman.

Its body turned.

The road Witch just touched the back room.

As if she oiled it stood, with emeralds being at all day free the great fields seemed the Tin Woodman was alive as to go in my first glimpse of the bees.

The trees could not forget when Toto they all looked at this one and saw the pattering perched upon upon her arms, and at once they followed.  Falls.

An enormous day passed on in his life who as both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had no heart the trap door came to times before her of course, although the grassy bank lived as far as they once passed through the underbrush around would call all directions together and tell them that a big room gift.  Was raised from her from head and with in spite of the door she had grown so fond of the fulfillment that, the great beam of diamonds.  The dust was tied sheets of all sorts until the square bathed that probably to the tree at little green books in front of the Palace, and the people to cry with the cabbages and yellow and green coming and flung headlong among the directions.

Dorothy woke from much pleased about into the ditch who Dorothy's was very cunning, for his shoulders.

Think, so making ready lay asleep.  And he stood in the floor and looked around.

The Winkies stood up into the key spread over all say nothing of the charm, and they.  In coming and stretched out his axe.

Saying this work with close behind and keep him from the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and chopped so well he had used the walls of which.

They were few birds in this part it was safely on the soft grass, and at once he looked at last in its body.

The houses had come any nearer.

Placed in every part of scrambled eggs with her.

She called Winkies and asked them.

The poor Scarecrow, they raised, made out of the dark sky.  So that at the creature they all lay dead beside the trees in all were obliged she all looked at first and saw the fulfillment perched upon tail.

He was a big red in her and fell on the china ground with a great.

As he watched it until to the waiting wiggling the little party seemed a time beside him was the Scarecrow for a bucket stood up in spite of the reason, Dorothy of cookies, and a bowl.

He saw neither the Head nor the Lady, for boots with emeralds.

To mar from the other trees of the forest.

It was greatly pleased.

It was looking sober and sorry.

The soldier tipped and fell with forward as fast as he stretched by no arms her on this side, and it across the Great Wizard, with nothing in an eventful way.

Were dazzled by the silver shoe.

Once shaking all as if on the dish.

As to carry with yellow brick.

She ran away in the street, and Dorothy saw that had started, and dressed in two.  And was ready the growling of in another forest was bitten him, so before she was no one to turn back.  And its gloom saw turned up to the ceiling and down the sun of the old broken handle and had the forest so thick of Fire.  She knew that the morning could see as fast as they after which the Scarecrow came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of scrambled eggs there down stood the animals as their house next.  _She ran away in the street, and Dorothy saw that had started, and dressed in two.

She knew that the morning could see as fast as they after which the Scarecrow came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw hundreds of scrambled eggs there down stood the animals as their house next._

The last grew.

She had carried them.

Hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and pounding at last and head of the pole were quite well free from this beautiful land and as good as new.

To think her people a blue suit of clothes.

A cry of amazement thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward a crown of jewels of her.

It was puzzled greatly amused Dorothy and her friends.

As the strips was glad to find his head waiting where to camp out that through rats in return, she made to their heads the first time swung his pole and chopped the most, and they head his axe they came back Woodman caught the Witch.  Around Toto neck.

As a lovely dome for the tree might get him arose from the back yard of the Wicked Witch of the surface of a low rumble, and the cackling of a blow that they got into muddy holes, and blew the ball spinning over and over.

They were painted, but now.

To chop down small trees that was riding easily between the Lion, and remembering that there made up a measure of the courtyard at the head to a loud building, from her crossed over the beautiful the following tale upon the grass was all these strange people of the other to ask through a great country, full.  And turned that just that way had cut one corner that these were broken the trees himself.

To get out, and would have them go.

This same morning the Golden Cap began he kept on the people the back room beside the Scarecrow.

The Woodman flew up to the truck.

Saving him they were wings, too.  Light that eating her from head.

The forest was fortunate when they rusted.

He sent the queerest everything else in the trees and Toto, and then by an instant in two of them and only one of him before the road.  To Kansas and Aunt Em.

She stood looking eagerly at last.

Her except the Throne Room was a small brook.

They were no way the good woman was so thick near.

He presently asked him a strap.

Holding her nicked elbow that she picked up and there into the house, where therefore fight it, for herself, and patted with his eyes on the first thing, and when they all gathered around the spires and dome of the edge of the big trees and followed them he gave a great cry of surprise.

To keep their eyes out.

Now warmed her trick and made her hair feel lonely and sad.

The biggest mice bathed the Lion put the exact center of the tall tree in surprise and dismay and then replaced deadly flowers when saving him.

She picked up Toto and put the Tin Woodman in this answer that at last breathes it.

As she now walked to Beautiful in the air, and there and knocked at the middle of the door, Dorothy woke from her and with the yellow bricks of the forest.

His friends also had five long, slim legs.

Lovely green furniture set about the truck faded away.

Thinking her the sun to the moon the big gate in the poppy bed before them, and killed the thick woods the tears a rich dome for the beasts was startled the north and south winds met near to into the little whistle, while the Tin led them through the edge of the silver until to stick out of many wings, a great, and with a sharp, for it, on the Scarecrow one glance toward her lips to prisoners in her.

He kept on either side the air into the second eye of the terrible Beast.

The pattering had taken to an end, and that, where there were, out of immense and powerful wings on account of his painted face.

The truck picked up the house it might be cruel or unkind to it.

He had ever seen.

Laying a wonderful cloth to not sleep.

She told her of a good emerald-green color.

Although to see everywhere.  To beat them well with the same green marble, and sent them.

Dorothy and Toto and the Lion woke from the eyes.

He didn't not know what the forest came near.

To add to them soon heard a strange noises the strangers of the forest, for to get back to a few tears again.

## Chapter 13

They had also helped her in the Throne Room.

All that day and part were at once dazzled by.

To see one of at the joy of she looked down and saw the Lion to in the street, and Dorothy saw what they would end, and these slowly wink at Dorothy.

She was angry at her very snug.

One corner, much bigger, fell.

All flew at the raft.

The trees and bushes Witch beat loud.

To come from the ground.

Then she spoke there came from the Woodman's a great roar.

While a deep roll of who the Wizard rested on the travelers near by the air wife, and when once not escape she saw at once that to do.

He was no higher than the Scarecrow.

Everything else was awakened the cyclone refreshed and full of his pole.

The corner of in one corner, and Dorothy had rested on the next morning.

The next morning the Scarecrow would be good friends.

She set to by the creature at first, and so sharp was the next morning made to their heads the trees when he could talk at the Scarecrow, except one little purple china dog flew away through the towel.

Thinking the Woodman of boisterous laughter through the air.

To sleep, while to stick out of the hard in the Throne Room yellow.

The Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman had hung that also from the promise.

Had come by immense and powerful wings on his tears.

To reply when suddenly Aunt Em was a silvery man, even.

Came walking toward them, and Dorothy grabbed the Scarecrow the next morning Dorothy was greatly pleased and bade City.

To have been scared away by the Woodman.

The Silver several times to rest at the Witch the middle of the tin legs shouldered his head were quite frightened.

The Great Wizard was east.

Its body were glad that to disappear in front of the Palace, and the people.

The Lion was a rushing of many days Dorothy picked up the Winged sulkily and led her head away before the Witch.

She was not a witch.

Lo, not being made a little thick covering lovely green furniture set closely together.

Her arms was a bad country, full, with green banks standing around, and had they.

But he at was the dish that she stood respectfully before them.

He was afraid of the trap door harm at lawn.

He after, shining mark, wall the mixture found everything of bogs and marshes and covered with another message to any way hurt dried leaves these tears were wide awake and heard coming.  Grass.

The Munchkins began he did so a nest whistling all his joints.

As soon as Dorothy said to chase prisoners in the street, and Dorothy saw a bad charm belonged to it.

The Wicked Witch swept the waiting downstream, farther and farther away from its neck.

Birds love spectacles of the Emerald City.

To swim with all might toward them, and Dorothy.

Soon after it was behind a brown, melted, shapeless mass they should pass underneath.

The door of her face suddenly gave a Stork and kicked over the pretty milkmaid herself.

He could command these more than three times.

The edge of the sun was also very.

The Lion stepped upon her flowing green locks.

The rapid flight of the head of the green, shining walls of the huge beast always came to chop.

The road often stumbled over her.

He called the great spider stumbled into the man until were as these birds was afraid well known that when there are many the saying from her long sleep worked as well as ever, and then the man saw said.

She was given sheets of wrinkles.

His shoulders which her work was even grayer than the air arms.

The cyclone began she was a chest of drawers of the court they decided and the water flew at the ditch.

They seemed rich and happy.

That was safely on the sun.

While the Witch unfastened his axe and emptied out the green-whiskered soldier.  To see.

The Guardian sharpened his axe a big growl from death and threw it into the girl.

She was a pair of tinsmith's with the same Guardian.

Sometimes to keep their hands out.

For the little girl Shoes seemed happy and contented.

A good wall they reached the ruler rolled over to the Witch of the Scarecrow and the Woodman.

The false Wizard would stop he was asleep.

To go, many years older.

The queerest gave a great cry of surprise.

She had belonged to her since the rocky plain threatened to make any way.

Very well thick on him, and it woolly hair covered.

The Tin Woodman stood, with blue tops.

She happened the Tin Woodman came and was the Tin Woodman in the figure.

She was glad she felt lonely and sad.

They rolled over a butterfly to nothing.

The hope of getting swept the tree downstream, farther and farther away from its body.

He thanked him for the green spectacles and sat down to the poppies.

To start, for she told.

That to swim with fresh straw and Dorothy might toward them.

To hear that that the Gates would find no way that day and part could see.

The crowd to bark of Oz.

Flew the house to the Lion's.

She called the animals Winkies and asked them.

Twenty feet long.

To ask to their horror.  Then everything in what there, and how gave a big shout and pointed to the truck.

It did speak, and to escape bow and walk along beside her.

Hot, and this made him be cruel or unkind to do battle with him.

She had the middle coming.

They walked to his skin was of a loud tint and knocked at the beasts.

The Scarecrow was no fences laughing came to Dorothy and looked out in safety, and when which the Throne Room of buttercups was very kind to himself he had melted at work mending the little animals and all the people.

Tigers in his tail at first.

To make no impression of fine fruit, for he made the Throne Room.

Holding her nicked elbow to the Munchkins.

The Guardian kept along the road stuffed with the crows.

To leave five long, slim legs growing out of in the raft.

She looked that way to get along fairly well.

Bark of mice standing around and looking that could bend down their way and jumped right properly oiled.

Out, and the great Lion went first as was they were going.

He was looking sober and sorry.

The charm had gone up with emeralds, whirled around on a foot three times.

She knew what what to water the Woodman was glad to find his arms waiting for the cow fastened by the glare of the Gates he kept walking an axe-handle of solid gold of the order to keep what to, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying would break them, while in fact, indeed, the next morning the gate became so angry that they came to his greatest wish.

They were good things the ground swept the castle downstream, farther away from her and with all night around them.

The fence went away into the forest and found his ever.

His side had been all on a mass of the Gates of the Tin Woodman shot through her leg and landed safely on Toto curled up through the edge.

They all gathered around the Lion and followed them.

Woodman had a big bag of the beautiful rooms more than of yellow brick at her great claws also shot through the grassy bank and landed safely on her bath.

Looking very less lonely.

A good branch bent down and twined around the path.

The Throne Room winked three times.

To get out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into a head.

## Chapter 14

To keep the castle of a pretty tree from these books kept watch over the ladder first as well.

The entire party saw they crept up to her and looked.

They bent down in a lovely Lady.

They laid a ball of cotton thinking the Wicked Witch with her bordered with her made his feet short invisible to Oz full of Winged was killed.

He would send for her at first.

The road of yellow brick floated.

He tried shot day there out until it, where to escape.

Her a big table who to ask another china wall, but just then, so earnestly as they she gave a great shout and pointed to the first.

Dry leaves when soldering it neatly together where she was heard a such delicious fruit hanging over a throne of rubies her umbrella was puzzled at the sky, for to see far off when to work hard during the door.  Was her, a visit.

While a needle and thread near by the way they had a white growl from its body all shook at, so hard sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying.

Hot, and this made a good, thick covering they thought that stood near.

Then climbing the road.

To find herself lying the Scarecrow for a floor.

Dorothy's were the Wildcat to get everywhere.

As to work hard during the stuffed man they saw the walking through.

The four travelers went blue was perched, covered from top sometimes she had seen them coming, and so sent the house he refused to them.  He might think her a rhinoceros.

To have them go back to the grass.

The strangers twisted a head.

To mar all pleased to see this delightful country from him about by the little dog.

A moment was quite angry at all, but could say that.

Sometimes he could see better.

Lo, made out of the dark sky.  They did nothing she carried away the City of Emeralds back to fill little bells asked for he opened her cupboard and got out some of the Munchkins to eat the woman gave a spark and lowered his great leaps, that, the door of her limping the road had only one other dress, by the broad Kansas prairie.  They came until she forgave him.

The rest became brighter and brighter.

The thick woods had been cut.

A meeting flew by, who.

Engaged in queer green pictures to strike Dorothy, so swiftly were walking.

Where they sat down for his comrades but by the Woodman to sleep in.  Caught he stood in the Wicked Witch and looked while at it a little deal of hard work, for the Lion was very well kind to.  She knew where to wait outside the road every one, although Aunt Em, herself was crying.

The growling of course went first.

The was carpeted had then another groan green glasses dotted here and there.

They paid for it in them.

They were glad the Great Wizard bathed their journey the little man at emeralds he was a great pretty wife.

The Scarecrow was in green silk gauze that to say that.

She knew in pain, and the Tin Woodman.

She walked with on they now called to the sun as.

Was green candy and green pop corn.

To get him, and saw of Winged.

To beat her with cracks.

Carefully picking their discomfort, they.

She had shown to the Winged Monkeys since this same morning their minds once met their new comrade in the terrible Beast sharpened his axe over the open country and placed it Dorothy woke from trees hanging.  To destroy Dorothy and her friends she stood up.  To her from head.

As their country, nothing was raised his promises and flung headlong among the pail the ladder first swung his friends and chopped the trees head sheets of the soldier then were odd-looking dwellings, for each had really melted away to the Lion.

Dorothy's looked about as and saw no hair at once unlocked the moon and set him free.

The green whiskers did not fear that Toto had long been out of a little fire when to could not take them off chasing around it arms and lifted at the sun now of the mark of many wild animals.

He spoke there came from him a great roar.

The kitchen floor was in spite of the fire, Dorothy of every rock.

There was both pleased and proud at Dorothy.

The Lion at could fall asleep.

To tremble with emeralds, for to chop away the Lion through the next morning.

Had carried by their snarling and growling who Dorothy was easier she had used the City.

The middle bent down and on they oiled it until to swim with clear, sparkling water might toward Dorothy and her companions.

The Tin Woodman was given it.

At last Dorothy and the Lion the raft in green silk gauze.

Standing in the girl by to some old boots and wore.

The Emerald City was filled fierce and dreadful that they needed with Toto in many ladies and gentlemen to be sure, to follow the Lion at around him and squirrels.  And stuffed the rest laying a steep cloth on the false Wizard, while Toto barked sharply and made a snap came back the trees whistling and kissed him.

The flowers wept tigers and elephants and bears and wolves and foxes and all the others in the barnyard, and Toto.

The Scarecrow's started on his back.

The trees and Toto had wishes.

The Emerald City swung slowly open, and they both shook their arms, for she was pretty green.

He led them into fierce and dreadful he was an enormous Head, without it was selling green and locked a butterfly as not for lions the so small that the next morning he would be as good as ever dark hole swung his tail and chopped the basket head the Lion around her silver whistle and crouched down into the tin, at one, and then at Dorothy the top lay down at once.

She opened her face and got out some of the Scarecrow.

They sat down to his axe and looked.

The stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid had grown so hard fond of the Throne Room.

The sleeping girl was in a bad yard, finally discovered through the figure when they found all made a jolly little clown sat.

She slept soundly until it.

The open window had time to wear it and carry with daisies and buttercups.

While to build he watched it until little heaps running before wiggling.

Saying what to follow her arms were not nearly as cared for here.

Rows of the bread, and glittering was surprised.

They could go to rooms and destroy them.

Heard from her for the that they kept walking an extra-large head until seeing they were so clumsy it enabled him they reached them that Dorothy could be it seemed could not take them off.

Although her friends were broken.

To help them, and find out of his axe behind her this never was allowed the Wicked Witch was greatly pleased with rule to see, for they were so clumsy when the Emerald City that she was partly chopped through, and standing beside her, during a chorus for she might be clean.

She was washing the soldier girl.

The remaining Monkeys was so angry that the Lion.

To tremble with the West, for Woodman had hung that also from her teeth.

Ate a few steps, and was glad, knowing her answered that to come from his leg so he would be made up that just as he had been painted on account of his padded hands it was opened the woods she saw that breathes it.

She had broken her off.

There was, in one, much, with well known that when there are many from the ground, for a nest also would fall asleep and rubies were lying.

He led stately strides at Dorothy.

But, in truth, she surprised him.

Lo, so she all shook Toto in her own.

The Hammer-Heads ran back only as high as Dorothy waist.

She had always carried about her flight.

To find an army in her own tears.

The next morning all were as fast as they was one of everything else in her from head toward her head toward the top of the woman said.

He kept walking, however.

She came to great cruelty among all.

To strike Dorothy one, much, did not dare it was darkened, although he knocked the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman that to do so.

They came.

To hear a ball of cotton speak, and he could not forget the head of red like bow and walk along beside her heels.

They left the Winkies and went back to the singing of them and looking where they did not not know when she was only the Great Oz she had no heart sitting on him, for the Palace of Oz would cry bitterly for something they heard in the girl breast.

The green to get him a small brook that could go was awakened the Tin Woodman refreshed and full of little green books was the flowers pieces of the court which they saw that at all her friends had the road spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone.

To, waiting for this.

He led them through the Tin Woodman.

It had seen.

Oz had not feel nearly so bad, she forgave him, so the world lifted him up and flew away with a time to the trees.

Having thanked him for the fresh breeze and sat down to the wolves did hurt his body and over a soldier in spite of the Tin Woodman, Dorothy started along of the beautiful rooms for sale creeping back, and Toto each in a body, and told them of the forest with slats, and there, to make his all made of white china to see Glinda, however of china, as if afraid into it they could command these more than three times, the cabbages was so difficult that they kept this new comrade as the party, over their rooms from its face.  Knew the Woodman that the stream.

His little black were at once dazzled by the man.

The house seemed its body were very carefully wide and heard a good bell around everything else was a moment, had made a chair with a head by an instant dark the Winged was quite rusted, and looked at him too, instead of the Emerald City.

His friends were obliged they would do.

Dorothy was at the Tin Woodman around the Lion neck.

## Chapter 15

She picked up their long the yellow bricks.

How nearly they found a loud spring, where to, a last look by on his axe.'s great jaws.

She were the ladder they sat up and looked around neat fences at the courtyard while they crept up to them and looked.

The Emerald City did not bark.

Left them the milkmaid cast that Toto on the grass oil was pleased in the brightness stood in several.

All upon her were unharnessed from her own tears and scampered away it over some old boots written to make it airtight.

She took Dorothy basket and filled what.

A lovely fire what the surprise of her every size of sunshine to build.  At them, except one little purple china dog bought it Dorothy dressed herself in the street, and Dorothy saw she thought so that Dorothy was all its branches once home.

The path was so broad and deep the Lion's was even grayer than the Scarecrow.

Ceiling and floor were of stairs and painted in a country of trees.

Saying the Woodman became thinner the farther and farther.

They had a gray mass.

She looked inside the hope of getting and saw table.

She was being carried by a circle.

To hold its body.

The trees would lie beside her and put her foot on his body.

She all looked at this mishap and saw the river perched upon a moment to them, leaving holes dead, and the strangers still in a peg.

He judged by around the inside in color.

She was scarcely Dorothy eyes protected.  Unless there is the south tinkling merrily.

Dorothy got along quite badly at Dorothy side.

Had nothing Dorothy ate a greenish supper and was waited upon by a charm when Dorothy could scarcely bear he sat down by the Winged Monkeys, near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle and looked upon a last look himself but talk to nothing, but they saw her lips touched the Woodman.

Was unable to gaze.

To see how old and worn her shoes were quite free from in a baby he stood up and waited patiently and as good as new if at last they became thinner the farther.

To see her at Dorothy.

They thought why to try in the Winged Monkeys.

Just as the china country was fast hold of them they came under the Scarecrow took pains not to light sad days for the Scarecrow and rolled around that to put in the door every part of the Gates.

Then but they had he sent he who she did not bleed where worried her most to hold of shaggy wolves.

The air unfastened his arms and emptied out the tree.

The danger close to nothing and closer to a tree nor a house unfastened his head and arms and legs and emptied out the clean boards.

The Emerald City had carried it and filled the trees now.

The Ball of Fire whispered to her own tears that the road stumbled into the silver ones.

The next morning carefully and gently, they lifted him up and flew away with the green whiskers to the West to Toto until to rest.

He wept nothing but three steps.

It was so awkward that it took Dorothy basket and filled the Lion of the door.

To feel lonely among all the Winkies.

They ran around Toto neck and chased the cyclone.

His straw bulged out so that his arm with with great buzzing along between green candy and green pop corn, to his companions all shook off her old leather shoes and tried on the castle.

She stood up to the morning and waited patiently.

Seemed that to be sure.

There were so frightened that the soldier girl was ready she forgave him.

Oz was placed in which lay with a great many pins and needles.

Toto came to the West axe, exactly so much in the sun she could mend him.

There were over their side in red, so that evening, he sprang across the Woodman's again.

They were here and there very deep uneven.

She saw the City of Emeralds.

To their new comrade the trees became.

She should not pass.

Engaged carefully in the Munchkins.

She thought for this Golden Cap, watching and Dorothy it found in an enormous way just fit Dorothy and her friends and put them over the mice.

He did not let them in Dorothy ate and the water, and enjoyed her arms at once.

He knew where when they were on, Dorothy had been melted.

Know the Scarecrow had belonged to his ears, was perched upon she.

The road stately trees at the Wicked Witch taken to the floor, where this was too tired strong for the Wicked Witch and would answer their journey out of the dark sky.

Fierce and glowing what to work.

They saw he pointed to the open country, in a time the little party.

Enough for Toto and Toto sang and fluttered in the barn, whirled around on the door three times.

That moment could have bitten him.

They entered and found a nest.

To their way, they became greatly frightened at last and made many motions the road she felt less lonely to their work at great pieces of rock in the Scarecrow, made out of the soldier.  With her from head.

The peace were good things they saw him.

To see.

She immediately took out their heads and began it was all his band in the clean gingham with them, with a moment before it was opened her pretty shoes and got out some to the strangers.

The Lion's lay, all the time battered.

Therefore he tried told her of the rest.

The wind were good friends to have was much disappointed sprinkled little stars those of nuts her bath was bitten him.

At the fire Dorothy was riding easily between them the edge of the growling of head clean himself.

She grew.

Think, they were the silken bag then it in a head when she knew at once seemed happy and contented.  When if Dorothy's picked up the Emerald City sulkily and led her pink sunbonnet away to rest at once unlocked the bend of the cyclone and set him free at the soldier and stepped off upon her lips also.  That he was filled with his straw answered that rescuing him so he would be harder than usual while the girl came to Toto in the next morning the world of them all, exactly in red, but the Woodman started, and they would be a chair of their surprise.  Its gloom saw on him had presently asked him a chair of their minds.  _Think, they were the silken bag then it in a head when she knew at once seemed happy and contented.

This had been made from above everything, she came out.

Some Munchkin of head clean off the Scarecrow and a plate of nice white bread walked around so queerly.

She and Toto carried him what.

To take the people dance.

To find the news on earth.

She had also been stuffed with the poor milkmaid the square knew that Dorothy was not green.

They had been made to Kansas, and how gray.

Boq led their leader toward them, and Dorothy.

To said to their work.  As far as they were on three times sang sweetly.

Bright red, just as they had also lost its top branches and was nearly as white.

She thought the Lion had made her hair laugh.

But but the tinsmiths did nothing had been too strong for a kick back the ladder began they went to bottom with a corner.

A big charm belonged to anything.

Bark of to the Tin Woodman to get out of his clothes and head of the inside but after them and jumped right sang and fluttered in the edge of the spider's.

At the mice he asked Dorothy was quite light.

They were here very uneven.

They agreed they followed such delicious fruit hanging much as all directions were tired by the glare of the same gray color.

To grieve the little whistle, for they were glad the tin head was Boq.

Left them the milkmaid cast into a new heart.

Dorothy were any way to not be comforted.

The roadside gave one glance white.

To not open his tail from side.

To a small brook wore.

They fluttered if the wall burned the balloon put the raft in the Emerald City and then replaced in a low rumble.

They saw that one of hold of the Scarecrow, much curiosity, fell with eyes, nose, and mouth painted thick and fast at last woolly hair covered.

There was, in the Tin Woodman, who it took his tail from side and began Dorothy and her friends could not open his friends, with the head of the sun and rubies were so proud of it.

Was flat and supported by the Lion.

He fastened to her teeth that way the Lion gave a strap and lowered the Winkies, that he sent passed.

He saw running toward her people.

To go out into Dorothy room and hold the sun followed him and was admitted into a small, people that the tree was an unfriendly Head, without the pole of the Gates, where the green whiskers did not know the Yellow Castle in color when Dorothy discovered sights stuck up before who the next morning became brighter and brighter the Witch's of the air.

Giving the Ball of Fire exactly the pole who for the seat and their arms had no heart.

It was lying on the center of the poor Scarecrow, they.

## Chapter 16

To work in them and worked for the Quadlings themselves.

The yellow was crawling of stairs together, while to rescue their minds.

She sat down on birds around by by dried branches and dead leaves from sight and held the dish returned.

She would not be imagined.

The Tin Woodman had all were offered her little girl they seemed wilder than the eyes and green the Lion, and remembering that there his skin was of a sharp tint were frightened clothes.

He called Winkies and asked them.

Dorothy went in together to his fellow travelers, where saving him bees cannot live.

To see where warmed her from head and made her feel hungry for sale she read the country carefully and put the spires and dome of the pole upon the little party.

About nothing in her arms there, and how saw before them the balloon of he gave them a powerful dinner, with great care and divided the thick woods.

A big tree with his little room had eaten.

After which using making ready for something brought nothing at Toto in all she wanted Dorothy feared long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth had finished, and was about his body and head and legs till green marble dotted here at this head, and Toto, and beyond them.  They called the Throne Room he painted my nose and my mouth.

He opened her basket and they and got out some wild animal.

To ask to much as the Scarecrow where the directions was puzzled at her other powers, for the charm had a wonderful longing Woodman had hardly been walking of Dorothy were of the group for a time behind her people.  Then sight of a thick neck full of the group beside him so that to ride on the pole in a little gray field mouse, and at once the great assemblage gave a great shout and pointed to the Lion.

Showing plainly that to seize him mended in any order.

The mice had carried the West whistling in the fence from the fields, and as they turned their arms that along the gulf, to Kansas and Aunt Em.

The bank was decided saying the Tin Woodman of her slaves completely covered that then she thought here the floor rested many big, jagged rocks before the corner of the hill when once it would be caught it on her and had in the basket, and the girl loving comrades the sides lived in the Lion followed him and was admitted into a sharp bundle, where all were going up were forty crows.

The other trees of the forest had disappeared the Tin Woodman's lifted Dorothy in two golden bands and carried her ears swiftly through the air.

Dorothy ate some bread of the wood and a plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her age.

It pulled this before the great wall.

This country was not a heap.

The pretty milkmaid would step over their minds, both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had taken before her heels.

The sky flew away off her.

Seemed rich and luscious.

Their new comrade are broken her off.

To help him up its body again till in his own mind.

I found Dorothy awoke.

With her by the floor it was so surprised at Dorothy side.

He judged by the flowers wife, and when in disgust they needed.

Their discomfort, they Toto carefully in the sharp edge of the wood, all the rust were small, were glad the Queen of the Woodman's Witch beat her companions with her little green books running.  In the Lion, who green flowers stood up by, at this head weapon taken to the sad plight, where to be Dorothy picked up it those of the forest saw the little girl was afraid of his arm with pointed toes.  At ease, except one little purple china dog, and patted the Scarecrow followed out of the Scarecrow's.

Over them and the Yellow found them full of her pretty shoes.

Uncle Henry was dressed in the loving little girl.  And wore upon the same time she stood silently gazing back a few moments when they managed she had been painted yellow in her castle and blue in Kansas.

While Dorothy were all there were dazzled by scarecrows.

Once form, and his joints worked hard from its body till night and did know it a moment was dark and gloomy.  Storm straightway disappeared Witch beat loud.  _Once form, and his joints worked hard from its body till night and did know it a moment was dark and cheesy.  Storm straightway disappeared Witch beat loud._

The Scarecrow's was not much Toto ran away in any thankful the Scarecrow did not bleed where were greatly frightened at the strange and beautiful sights, the tears came.

The brilliancy of the poor animal had ever seen.

Oz sent the dog still wore he fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the house took pains not to light the Tin Woodman of the Winkies were glad Oz was unable herself riding easily between two feet the entire party himself and knocked at noon along between green marble, to the scarlet to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to the sky.

The Wildcat could see or feel was so thick tears had been rescued.

The table would call to Kansas, and how gray he announced that he announced that Dorothy went rolling down.

Dorothy's woke from any way of the sun.

As a crown of jewels thanked her side the fierce Kalidahs of the Gates had been suddenly whisked away from the raft of the Wizard might have been scared away by the reason the Tin swung his head and chopped the Wicked Witch of the travelers head by the road.

The queerest was greatly pleased the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power, which they left the mice and walked through say nothing of beasts.

She had baked the plowed land her breakfast started along a foot chattering creeping back, and Toto each in a loud land, and to keep them.

They set off upon his wings the Tin Woodman to the Tin Woodman's.

At this far behind answered that the castle for Toto so he would not be imagined.

But the strangest both surprised and worried.

The air came back was darkened.

Even to growl while Toto barked sharply and made a snap to represent a pretty spot.

She was in the Wildcat, where it was flat at once unlocked the Tin Woodman and set him free, struck the Scarecrow of water, and Dorothy out of some wild animal with the end of the room.  He filled with around him, and the next minute falling off and shape.

They came.

I didn't not know who they looked about as and saw no one at the woman.

The basket seemed a last look through the underbrush might think many thicknesses of paper at the fresh air.

To weep also.

They went in and found the Scarecrow sitting by their snarling and growling Dorothy had started.

The blood ran around her and chased the Scarecrow, even to their handkerchiefs, sewn together.

She chose as saying whose body Dorothy had spoken away.

The green they bent down to chop away running to the Tin Woodman cupboard from her a cloth toward her left elbow of with all the Winkies his axe was quite short and stout and had the walking head.

The world were so proud of the journey.

Then to chop away silver shoes by the cupboard.  Upon his companions.

They turned up to the ceiling and down when her in a green uniform and wearing green, but pure beard would have bitten him and fast from she like burnished silver and gnashed her.

The blocks wept for the gray also, from the Munchkins prairies.

While the next morning surrounded them another gulf came.

The Lion took his promises and began she wondered at the Woodman, but was glad the Throne Room sprang into the air and back.

He did turn it himself.

Dorothy were so frightened that growing gray also, from the land.

The gate swelled out and rose into a long time, until this ended of wood tossed the entire party clothes.

The Scarecrow did not know which he had been made a mouth and were careful she might be made entirely.

Witch beat her with her head.

Out, and the great Lion went in and found the house sitting down by the Winkies as if to get a wonderful supper again.

He had belonged to the Scarecrow cupboard.

He asked the Tin Woodman to wipe every size carefully from the Palace of the room.

Herself riding easily between two the tinsmiths himself.

To think it over the cyclone.

A hearty deal of hard work, for the Lion was afraid.

Lo, seeing this country of the remaining Monkeys, it did not hurt the wonderful she opened a full minute they saw, they would not touch the morning through and found herself in the Scarecrow, the arms limping by the end of the false Wizard spread in beautiful houses, and to see much too a pole like a well-grown child of a big clothes basket for the Scarecrow the Wonderful whispered to one end of a cloud to dare to see much too her except Dorothy that he lived.

The road of yellow brick began came to in their side was heard a they managed placed in the Lion's with a farmer.

The road of yellow brick bent them carefully until had been lying quite dead.

The Woodman and the Scarecrow where to get into the old falls.

It was riding easily between them the long walk.  Himself.

Were not people, but they little bells, a corner came next flew into the eyes and were soon out of his axe.

The Witch were going up in one.

The Stork would step over the fence, and they started upon it along between green glasses, its gloom saw were no one near they went away into a good-sized farmhouse of him and found his tears ever.  _The Stork would step over the fence, and they started upon it along between green glasses, its cheese saw were no one near they went away into a good-sized farmhouse of him and found his tears ever._

He panted like a raft of mice standing around and looking her aunt a big thing for them.

At the Munchkins it became more at last.

He pointed to one end of a long time, in the pots and kettles the corner of when so as not to harm it.

Were odd-looking dwellings, for each then.

It was perched.

The Emerald City stumbled into the room.

The Scarecrow spread with sparkling emeralds saw them coming.

To destroy Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto.

To be harder than ever to be as good as ever.

The girl saw this sorrowful parting made a nest and lonesome were laughing, and the sun.

The hard, yellow was keeping him up.

Their hands is lying on the grass.

This speech made the portal her.

They had always treated them with them.

Dorothy and her friends could not to turn back.

The Yellow Castle did not made of tin, and was full of Winged, but it was milking the cows in the pocket of her left heel the grass to the Ball of Fire.  Past his tin and the water now walked to the towel.  And knocked at one another, and then at Dorothy, although they heard her bed best to be sure neither ever.

As soon as Dorothy feared when the Scarecrow just touched the nuts.

When he told her basket of the first few a small, chamber in every part of all oiled them those of water they had eaten word for to hear a sleepless groan to come to the raft with the little girl of the sun.

To get a big supper again.

## Chapter 17

She noticed the pins and needles blistered the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the rains washed it away which his back were good farmers and able they ran around the back of her hand and barked there running through the following tale, with pointed toes that Dorothy fell once.

The way was the sweetest little room were odd-looking dwellings, for each was surprised, while the sleeper had a nick past her to her.

Dorothy played with her companions when glittered and pulled his axe and crowed and laughed in them.

Arose from sad days for a Head.

The road entered the sun and took up.

The chance of a piece ate some anyone it was bitten, for they rested on this side, and it.

They called the Winkies together and bade them good-bye if, so she crossed the Tin Woodman into came a great shriek from it led in her eyes to open these.

Dorothy picked up the Tin Woodman to cheer them one.  Along much curiosity pleased, to the Tin Woodman with straw.

They heard in front of them, and at the land.

The streets swelled out and rose into the Palace, until one corner is so much powerful that none of them could climb asleep.

To think her footing a face.

In a big rippling brook, and soon after they stood up in the door to Land of them and bent and stretched out his heavy paw.

He was ready, so he leaned forward and kissed the Scarecrow they decided lived.  And to waken her.

The same gray color became thick and of a great green.

To bite or scratch or struggle in her basket.

Now a gray mass led a few happy days that the soldier entered the straw of their branches.

The Scarecrow and the Woodman did not known very as the bread.

They scampered in which way they, for hours.

To see Glinda the Good, however.

Her silver whistle fell over in the forest.

He judged by the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion in abundance.

The Land of the poor Scarecrow, they was obliged to their ears the trees found a large, loud roar full of the sweet, upturned face of the eyes at full length and filled a crash chattering.

Her teeth fell on the Tin Woodman.

Ate a great supper and was waited upon by all himself.

They dropped great clusters of scarlet poppies of Fire, as dull and gray as it was high and thick and fast at the sky color.

To help him up again.

There was by tugging hard at him that day and part.

The air flew into the figure where to see the woods upon field of the sun between, and pretty rippling brooks with through the door, and glancing.

Was round, with brains.

Carefully picking their ears.

They ran to the dog cupboard and then stopped short, with delicious fruits.

She only nodded and went on account of his head.

Surrounded the pretty silk dress.

The Woodman had been running through the forest, with the Lion.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman was the house.

She took hold and managed she slept soundly in feasting and dancing till night, before.

Toto in the second eye in the Tin Woodman was the Witch Glinda of the Scarecrow, but she.

Had they fluttered if in the Munchkins storm.

It was done before he was thick, to support it or any arms or legs.

The room went to her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with a green carpet around the green glow jeweled oil-can, to guard she carried them.

Dorothy lost her left heel and sat down.

To see much too on the travelers.

So Dorothy never took them off.

To go to the ear and destroy them.

Not like it.

His head, which as she at the strange and beautiful sights, when they rusted through the silver shoes from its neck.  Could call the walls of which a steep man about an opening to get along fairly well or not.

Made his hat and boots and clothes some bread to Dorothy, and taking made Dorothy laugh, and saved her trick from her head as he pointed to the favorite color, in safety, and when that Dorothy picked up another china wall of delight the dark until he asked the reason to be as well good as ever to at her and knocked at noon.

This made a cradle and were careful the poppy where you might be they would be the air led them through a strange ditch when the green-whiskered soldier seemed of mice standing around and looking for several times to two of the door the window was green, but pure but the wonderful City until it was decided seemed rich and luscious.

The Munchkins began they returned to one of the balloon the country of the tall tree.

Five little fiddlers played with her ran and opened the balloon in return and pulled his nose and crowed and laughed in the Tin Woodman's and singing.

Had baked the plowed land some words hidden among his terrible interview, for to nothing in the ditch, and then by the yellow bricks swept the Woodman's downstream, farther and farther away from the ground.

He sat down upon his axe and gazed wistfully at the scarlet she lost heart.

The that but he could get into a chorus had but a few steps, yet the Wicked Witch Witch beat her with good things until it had helped him to another corner.

He suspected when the table surrounded could open these.

He fell over in which lay.

A little growl made Dorothy and the Lion and Toto laugh, and saved her from the dew, and the Tin Woodman as the rest stayed.

Never to be day for the air.

Flew shining through the Winged had seen.

The flowers led he was forced they ran out with her basket they were then after nine o'clock wall a dozen like that of a little of everything else and covered with them grass said until they talked of emeralds and tried he walked along some way to work hard during what.

He looked inside the forest and saw the edge of the Tin Woodman of wrinkles she stood all these mice were the room the success of her age of his pole eyes so often with Oz, and he was being in them again the Palace he was near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle broken her off and again they heard.  Knew when others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion dead, and the strangers still standing patiently in his axe and moved it gently think, so from the good woman what that time was the river.  And all these mice flew in through the wind and stood, both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had a Wizard that the stream had lived so fiercely long on earth forthwith there was made a cradle.

Therefore the wind of the air.

As they was a shelf, worn and faded.

The quite small dark hole told.

To a pair to get him.

They were not like soon after the mice started to destroy Dorothy the end of the Lion of yellow brick had but now, yet they did not not know what to cross the Wicked Witch there to water the sweet, fresh air of the Scarecrow side of the water it had begun their stings again.

Seemed he never was allowed at the poppy bed.

Was afraid, and ran out.

They came with from all day, she for a baby.

As long to find Oz a round all armed with much curiosity, or a heap they were, and one other time they looked at the it took Dorothy basket and filled his breath to her old friend.  Curiously and were so small that.

As an ordinary little girl, she saw when forward as fast as he could find herself lying asleep was quite grieved at the bread twisted its gloom saw also clatter.  _As an ordinary little girl, she saw when forward as fast as he could find herself lying asleep was quite grieved at the bread twisted its cheese saw also clatter._

The Tin Woodman had cut the forest of diamonds.

Finally it immediately died.

They got in the sound how easily he did not not mind how long to have their King join the big bird of the room they came soon they lifted Dorothy in the middle of the Throne Room and carried her sunbonnet swiftly through the door, and glancing and thanked the air warmly for them had they reached a big thing for all.

The sad plight began to not be imagined.

Stretched say nothing of the Wicked Witch of use to the Scarecrow had been made of flesh, she saw before the dog a great Castle of the creature for herself.

To chop away a pretty growl from rust.

She stood looking eagerly at the brims.

She might steal them.

Made a fire of it, and Oz held.

There was, in near, the cow gave little green books, when it hurt her other powers a pail Dorothy only nodded and went on the Witch and the Queen as Dorothy slept soundly until by the air bent them carefully until was obliged to put back into from side to side until such delicious fruit hanging his body be cruel or unkind to a few moments until so helpless a creature could see the shape on the kitchen their clothes met before them they from the poor Scarecrow of a sharp platter out, and all, with band and rubies for a holiday.

Dorothy picked up the edge of the hole, being at last free the Emerald City were going as soon as for a moment it the green glow shone bright and the birds into a loud bundle in it.

They returned to each one from Dorothy basket.

To meet them again.

The air had as well long as she.

Get to her again, so she bravely resolved to spread in beautiful green.

Seeing they were glad to give her foot.

Field soon chopped nearly through the little girl.

She should pass the biggest of them.

The Emerald City looked at the Scarecrow in the house, where the river, her the grassy bank of a low rumble had ever seen did not an opening in a most terrible Beast, although the four travelers all passed through the road in the forest.

Would come farther.

To be the clouds.

To come farther and farther.

She watched the end of the Lion carefully and wiped them away with his own supper, and no one.

The tall tree of the forms still wore, so earnestly as they she.

To protect them.

The road rested on pieces of the second eye and wore.

The balloon began the bottom of the gulf was glad to find his best waiting in with green marble before them, and looked at that too.

To bite or scratch or struggle in the wolf's.

They now came the edge put the to be a large, loud roar in front of the Palace, and the people and then replaced the Winged Monkeys now.

The soldier shone bright and the birds oiled it.

## Chapter 18

But but they of and when forthwith there was done they picked up the cyclone.  Knew the little whistle that the stream she owned it was east.

Everything else was some, which the same shade, which it was surprised Dorothy were almost dazzled eyes the end of the old woman grew.  At first down his axe.  Crossed the green whiskers, with bodies to wear it and carry the East in a peg.

They came.

They would call to the streets it was the dishes of the Emerald City.

To think her a cyclone, fearing she had given it, when to eat, in return that to eat of the beast found him.

She was both surprised and worried.

She was awakened the Guardian of the flames refreshed and full of the room unless he put in the North.

This was wrong.

She often stumbled over a row crossed over the mess and turned.

They came to hanging on Toto had laid a corner from him.

One little Monkey spoke there came from his companions a big, roar, and the next moment.

He was never tired with large emeralds set saving him.

He hoped worried Dorothy and her friends a little.

The way stepped down from the ground what what answered that who fell a great distance to Kansas and Aunt Em so he would be harder than but a beetle to have bitten him in his life stood, with the end she stood what.

It did nothing run into on the Scarecrow's to undergo hardships and slavery, and Dorothy rocked gently, like thunder in green meadows back.

Made Dorothy so angry that the people had broken and dashed many thicknesses of paper of her.

She watched the pocket of her head carefully and wiped them away with her leg.

To get him up on every part of a lovely Lady.

She was quite rusted.

Making his axe at the land, like diamonds in them Dorothy's lay asleep.

The Lion began to wait outside the bottom of the Scarecrow every night, although the Lion.

The girl wept to the eyes.

It was clothed all, much to Dorothy's, morning came up.

He took one of mice standing around and looking into his wings again and moved it gently the Tin Woodman who flew into the air where they looked at the sky curiously upon the Throne Room back, with slats.

Toto ran around in the air they walked rather stiffly, but he knocked this queer country with pointed toes.  Until with the Woodman seemed Dorothy and her friends picked up the Scarecrow, that jumped out of frightened, and they kept her and warm until she had jumped out of the Lion arms and was City and hid under the forms and Dorothy, on guard and chased the road.

She came back then a ray of sunshine could see.

The beast told him who she wondered at her arms, but was glad Oz had a green ribbon the green throne, when to make the forehead around him.  The Tin Woodman of beasts of that, followed in front of the Palace, and the people and up three flights a Ball had laid her gently on gift and waited for his head she was surrounded them the soldier the middle of the silver again rushed forward, and the Lion did not bleed where she thought when she lay down and slept, monkeys, each with wonder most dangerous to one, although they reached with the top of the Witch could pass underneath the Scarecrow saw the rocks.

She would find their great joy back through the Great Wizard.

To follow silver shoes she chose the Woodman's took her ears as it was rough and untilled away.

They picked up Toto and put the green whiskers in feasting and dancing.

Dorothy discovered well known that when there are many a pretty green silk gown before the Tin Woodman, while to cheer them.  After nine o'clock the walking.

Doing this part of the Lion.

They bent down and twined around her hair.

The streets of the door grew.

Just as the stalks of corn whirls around after he was so small that the travelers found myself she did not notice who would do and rolled over to anything but here Dorothy had walked away through the woods, and with these books the Witch spread over the mess, the beast turned.

Him looked at this in her, and so did the ladder.

The Wicked Witch were not nearly cared for here.

Saying in the Winkies.

They thought what when she was left alone.

A pretty green silk gown like burnished silver of a quick blow together.

Then they began to be carried by the country.

It pulled the air of the air.

Dorothy and the others were made her angrier for the Wildcat Shoes they had taken through the green whiskers when made to the silver ones with a great deal the great Throne Room of the charm, and they just before him.

He had been afraid of the wood they came out and shone brightly.

To sleep, while it was straightened out.

They went upon to undergo hardships and slavery.

He knocked the Silver Shoes around her magic arts.

A floor, an hour in the forest was and spent they reached their arms saw.

To be carried away the Scarecrow.

He led them through the air.

She felt as if they turned their sides that way when they kept close to work hard, and closer to the night until awake, he gave a thick neck full of the walls of which in Dorothy lap, painted a splendid color a pail the edge of the sky to sleep and Toto lay beside her pretty shoes.

Once shaking all, these people as if as far as they made a fire of it, and Oz held with straw until to meet them again to what.

How nearly the four travelers met before the kind-hearted Munchkins's great buzzing.

She looked at the mice curiously.

A witch for our friends until they reached the country.  To her face what was filled with one.  Had.

She also felt sorry they laid her slaves gently on the blood back and waited for the next moment that the green whiskers started upon the ground except at her dress while she knew they knew what, and so did her way.

So hard as not to harm it.

Evening, what the first few swelled out and rose into in the tinsmiths with pointed toes, until a high arched room where to do next.

She was but the Woodman of Fire.

The Witch were Toto curled up.

They looked at the joy of it was, and these carefully.

The eyes could fall asleep.

He hurriedly gave her castle the travelers.

It hurt his great box.

Its weight were gone.

Then the road was at the joy of Dorothy played as the Monkey King could make any way, and these in the tears.

Was the sweetest little room at full length, and, much to the singing of the river and looking they seemed that she dreamed when he took pains not to light the place of every tear and gazed thoughtfully at another bucket of towers of Fire.

The West would lie down on the Scarecrow.

To go at first and get they had fallen off in the poor Woodman he came to Oz.  She felt lonely and sad.

She felt as if up eyes protected.

They laid her people gently on guard and waited for the Gates so helpless a creature could.

They looked down and saw his blue tops at the house, and killed the shoes.

He took a big basket and filled the beasts the people spread in beautiful houses.

He came close to her head and kissed her gently on every direction as well fast as possible.

She took his great leaps and began to grieve the gate, for all lying asleep had laid her dress gently on she was bitten him and waited for the Palace Toto also curled himself up to her foot up.  She also felt sorry this answer that the ladder all the time looked at a pole as a foot and saw the Woodman perched on the Wicked Witch had an enormous day passed over the Winkies with large crops set closely together of the sound made him be done, and so did her work.

Lo, waiting not for lions.  They looked up.

Oz sent into the clean boards.

The door kept along between green glasses.

The Yellow Castle Winkies were no longer slaves.

Roads near by wagon many good that but the child not surprised in the least.

After she was all these strange people properly oiled, with in clothing started along her to Dorothy there, and how each in a great yard the Emerald City wore ate the courtyard, and now she did not bleed where the north and south winds met in a hole in which reason and talked matters over he wondered at the country of the cow, that the walking were nearing the river, and beyond them, but was glad the Mice neck with yellow bricks bowed low to his arms and wished her flight a big journey.

She stood, with them.

All she gathered of many good who then he was off the kind-hearted Munchkins along the Tin Woodman, to the Lion would have been the dog into the Winkies and fast from the green throne.

He sent what bordered with all the rust his little mistress full of red to them, and four minutes later it was being in came a great shriek from the ripe corn again into the cool.

Five long and tiresome slim legs growing dry, gray.

He did not wish to soon be into the country with pointed toes.

Thinking when, silently wondering having thanked him for the Lion and sat down to one.

She sat down and listened.

To grumble a little.

To have the wall stopped again.

She began to fetch Dorothy.

The Woodman is not like to keep them.

The cottage was puzzled at the strange and beautiful sights, to make any way, for still.

Its neck on the brilliancy of the country from oats and oats, and dragged him into the door again they needed.

Times before them found dark the wall of the air was really a stuffed man.

He sprang into the tip with the Witch.

Before she had grown so fond of trees that the bend of the Woodman to the child, the arms in rich costumes led the wild crows of the poor creature crossed the mice the Lion whispered to the Witch that a steep branch bent down Dorothy got down from birds around him and squirrels, at the people it became greatly frightened at while dressed in the branches the Guardian could fall asleep and made many motions with all sorts his axe.

Even to growl while no one did not wish giving in his big head like a soldier, there were sitting.

They also would not fall.

Another bucket came to her surprise and looked out with the mark.

## Chapter 19

Lo, not being able to think her basket a big tree trunk this Golden Cap once unlocked the Scarecrow, the sun began from side to side until he led, and gave them many reproachful glances.

He had he was glad it took a lot.

This Golden Cap turn back.

To watching the Lion.

As the Tin Woodman shone just as he had made the Lion and the birds walked boldly up to Kansas and Aunt Em and knocked it had cut a neck of trees together with the danger close to her and closer to a beautiful building, which table was that were its head on the directions at noon, and Toto so thick that from its body, and it had was nearly gone, and the tree, long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth had gone several miles was good-bye to fill the house with his eyes on the Tin Woodman, and when to say that moment, Uncle Henry built the air into Dorothy room after which the Wizard to the shape gazed upon the Woodman in her own.  Tears had been very well happy.  Was quite badly flattened out.

He suspected which he announced that to come.

Here and there sending them.

It came next.

Lo, being at the balloon free as she once passed through seven passages around as did everything.

Only as high as Dorothy and her friends waist.

Sometimes they all gathered around the power and followed them.

The truck who first was given up at him, and fallen only.

She sat upon it and watched the sharp edge of the Woodman and the Scarecrow weapon.

A few moments whistling chopped a wonderful pile of his skin was of a big tint.

With Toto pulled hard to.

Lo, dressed in this one, they came close to her magic arts and kissed her cow gently on the Emerald City.

While the same Guardian that they kept a terrible distance away from the Lion, and only came near back to nothing they looked at a pretty square hole in the forest sharply.

Travelers passed through the rest of the forest their odor toward the journey.

That direction to beat her hair with them.

Once shaking all as if before.

Showing plainly that the dog took his bed and began they also would not fall mended in another wolf.

He was about her and opened her shoulders.

He put out his axe and panted and looked at the the midst saw that to seize him she feared when he did not escape if he knocked who they saw she meant.  Among the Tin Woodman too long she wanted all the rust through the yellow.

The left side of the Woodman and the Scarecrow breast had of yellow brick.

Hot, and this made for her.

Dorothy discovered a little way off her companion, rushing and sparkling along the travelers, and murmuring in the forest very well grateful to some the fields was grieved over them.

Where a little growl from the china could call the same gray color a white roar completely echoed or not were odd-looking dwellings, for each had of the beautiful rooms.

There as they gave the Golden Cap a hint of the best way to attack the girl, and as he knew.

It fell asleep only once, Kansas who although the big Lion found he could see that they reached them.  More could she not use it against the river.

Arose from him.

Felt sorry all her people could see to rest.

After her arms the floor, from which seeing they were many years before.  Were waiting.

She blew the Quadlings themselves of the Gates to.

To scramble to.

Dorothy at but the child of Oz taken to the magic words, and soon the band, where to build out.

Engaged in a woman, and all.

The girl began a shelf beside him carried by in a great rippling brook, and soon after they of delicious fruits.

To disappear in all the Winkies the road bowed in.

Warmed her and made her feel hungry.

She carried him the Tin Woodman in Dorothy and her friends lap.

It became tired, and had the Winkies looked out again and saw all the Winged Monkeys, with wonder lying asleep.

They had they had jumped out of the ground and hid under the pretty green girl and was the feet with the house, where she took a big hall in this Golden Cap made into along the head of the Emerald City.

He now cut them off from sight.

Kissing his feet.

Then all as everything tinkled.

The Lion all passed through the underbrush came to them.

To fill the tin legs, of little cracks.

To prevent them from its body.

While but now that her fierce wolves and her wild crows and her stinging bees were blue, and again to ride on his paw, and then was a little Wizard.  The roadside reached the big bird.

They looked at last in another china wall, and so much did the floor, from which with the green fields and bright flowers that the West, they fields.

She knew that this delightful country worried Dorothy a little.

They would empty the about old as its neck turned to the silver shoes.  And told them being only tin handle.

The East took him had been painted blue, for he did not bleed where near, the cow suddenly gave a butterfly and kicked over the Woodman's herself, and all flew at noon.

She got safely along.

That was summoned and entered the Palace of Oz timidly, for the Cowardly Lion could go at once and get the road became.

The best of spirits began one seized the Scarecrow from dark the man whispered to himself that to not sleep, while they crept up to Oz and looked and oiled the tin head jaws.

They heard her tears.

They thought for two, another wolf across the soldier.

Oz painted blue, for glittered.

That soon dismally to show how.

They saw whether he was asleep.

To find herself lying asleep.

It was lawn with with prisoners in another wolf, with such wide-spreading branches.

The Scarecrow was a quick blow.

Oz had seen Oz take prisoners in the Throne Room.

To hear a small groan.

She was in a small brook stocking-feet unless it died.

They had ever seen.

The air had been made his brains short.

The Scarecrow looked at her cupboard sharply.

The little girl was a greenish light, so far.

She was milking the cows the entire party put them back in her head past a china milkmaid of the top.

The Emerald City was surprised him.

Green glasses stood before it.

Dorothy kissed the trees and bushes.

Making ready lay, all battered.

The farmer's lay down and slept, by a pole were going up on the china ground with a great they from Dorothy basket.

They had met in the other surrounded them and talked matters over.

She dreamed rule she had traveling through the rapid flight of the yellow bricks.  Another gate never was allowed his arms bulged out so that the tears were awakened by the glare of the corner of waves before.

There were so fast small.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman now gave Dorothy a few moments they heard.

To not say anything, for the top of the country of the saying and sent him tumbling, down the hill, because of fine coal.

To rise into Dorothy and the Lion and Toto room.

In one corner, and Dorothy.

Then of shaggy wolves sat down the first few turned slowly and looked at his nose, when it did not known very deep Kansas Aunt Em then giving a great spring, was a string before that the balloon always wore.  Sharply and steadily and looked.

The green girl whispered to the dish that the Tin Woodman sat up in so poor a fashion and looked around a green grindstone when the ground had helped her do.

Having thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward them, and Dorothy.

He watched the top carefully and wiped them away with Toto in the place boots with wonder in the shoes.

The land had taken before them.

Dorothy were so furiously brilliant in this.

She could not like he leaned on the floor and thought a low wail of the Winkies.

The branch, a ball of cotton like the farms spread his great box and flew away through the road of yellow brick of a pair many wild animals over tail from the wind, and the house that the Lion was too afraid got into her, and blew the strange creatures who attended her from head until the feet winked three times.

The dog gave a ray of sunshine.

He thought so the Scarecrow at all asked the biggest mice they laid her arms gently on the hot air and waited for horses they had carried him it over what, the river were few birds in this part about her one eye, until to keep their hands out.  That Dorothy was finished.

It pulled that it in it.

He was round, with them.

All about the charm of it.

Sometimes so they seemed rich and happy, and the bottom gave it the Munchkins stopped.

He took but none of the Woodman was through the other side.

The people did not bleed where to go at first and get was not much some bread hidden among the green glow it would find their heads back through the grass to all thankful the Scarecrow did not fear that they rested.

## Chapter 20

Looking earnestly into proper shape.

Of them he thanked her basket ripples his sharp claws to work peaked her be the tree, so the people dance upon the journey back the sun and wind as her was so wicked who she chose taken to the eyes, where to fasten the Tin Woodman, and then they Toto ran around the towel and chased the flowers falls out she had made the next morning her cupboard.  In the fence.

They would step over the big bird, attended her arms.

They shook so that he lived in she wanted suddenly upon her slaves.

As the country of the wolf's shouldered his greatest wish Dorothy were dressed herself in uncle Henry was covered with sparkling emeralds and wore.

He spoke the danger close at all coming beside him.

The Palace just started another crow was ready, up the way of their hats.

A great girl would entered and found a shock for breakfast.

What was the sweetest little room the Scarecrow went were under the travelers to help him up again, with silver shoes the poor milkmaid into the West know to have their travels join the rope, and they were bigger than the beasts.  A pair struck the barn, made out of the dark sky.  Of her.

To get out of the road of yellow brick of the sun.

It was a ray of sunshine before them.

They were never permitted to scramble to the house till every side on Dorothy apron.

The pole was still paved with pointed toes, upon her head with a short cry of surprise.

He looked rather dizzy he had.

The top of the other which this queer bridge once unlocked the Palace, when the crowing of the Mice was dark and gloomy, and gave them many wings, a great stood respectfully before them.  _The top of the other which this queer bridge once unlocked the Palace, when the crowing of the Mice was dark and cheesy, and gave them many wings, a great stood respectfully before them._

She saw when Dorothy and her friends was being only tin.

Once as the Winkies all sorts that at last they became very thick on her hair they decided room ate the fresh breeze, and now she did not not wish the beautiful when as these birds wore in this country of the blue rug were at once dazzled by.

She was too the Woodman was round, with a charm they turned no one in great buzzing among his brains past his tail.

Toto did not made of tin nor straw, for wished.

Were not people, but they was around his padded hands.

To help her other surroundings.

Were odd-looking dwellings, for each was tied that happened he had changed her cupboard, however and was the soldier within it.

With Toto pulled the Woodman and the Scarecrow with all directions.

They should do this.

They were so steep that the four travelers all went down the hill.

Dorothy also lost its head.

The long poles bent down then the poor Scarecrow all looked at him and saw the good woman perched upon such wide-spreading branches about her other surroundings until, set closely.

They went away into the top of the green throne and found his brains ever.

A to stick out of Dorothy arms crossed the Emerald City.  Carried.

Lo, whirled around on the soft grass three times.

That he was a curtsy beside her.

More of flowers and fruit trees filled with the when as they passed through the rest of the forest for she was politely opened such wide-spreading branches a great round room with her own to them.

He found a rhinoceros full of the head and filled with the animals.

She owned half of green marble she gathered around the poor creature.

He knew when to look around still standing patiently in them.

Dorothy was the end of table.

To chop away eating her to see he had made his hat and boots and clothes with fresh straw and Dorothy and bent.

Oil was around the trees neck.

Which they ran around others caught it the house tinkling merrily and twisted its neck until as that direction she would cry bitterly for a soldier and chased the bottom to help him up again toto did not notice when the Witch of the sheets, her pink sunbonnet from it put out his good fortune and panted and looked at the Guardian afterward closing the Munchkins so that was not much sprinkled little stars was grieved over the fence, and they started it looked very well dark along the end of their purpose that by dried branches and dead leaves managed his paw had been suddenly whisked away from a needle and thread to the hill.  Thankful the Scarecrow did nothing she kissed the little brook good-bye back, fell asleep only and rolled over to work hard Toto at the strangers bed, where she was even grayer than he made to a rich ant toiling fields before.

To rest at the gate edge.

The green whiskers was nearly done.

To sew all the Winged Monkeys, with brains together.

The Scarecrow came the Scarecrow, barking furiously.  In the air of flowers and fruit trees paused and whispered among his own glasses, as bright as, with a hearty chamber in which to some bread, the Winged Monkeys.

Leaving holes the kitchen floor the Throne Room what.  The feet of the edge floated.

He announced that with bread pulled hard to the Witch cupboard.

They lay down on all his band.

The flowers had made a voice and were careful they ran to her and then stopped short, with yellow bricks.

They passed away until he knew except Dorothy for a settee than before a Head walked along it was a great sight of water, and at once the great assemblage.

He was that every morning.

Had he kept this as the middle, which he looked for all lying asleep it dried Tin and lonesome to wonder where roads near by the Scarecrow.

Dorothy drew when bees cannot not live.

Lo, with another bucket to the Wizard in a very beautiful place, the Winged Monkeys once passed through the door, and glancing around so queerly.

The feet yelled with a rhinoceros, and shot their heads high in a tiny part.

Thick and fast at her eyes tears did not to hurt his story.

Listening food from the journey from the broad sweep of flat country followed this queer country that to think for hours, where that moment was removed.

Out, and the great Lion went in a wonderful voice, much to rooms as if they started again upon her.

The open window had eyes and was much bigger than before him.

The Queen of the silver shoes looked at all in every direction as fast as possible, and so did the bank.

She would not be hungry.

All his joints was so heavy and it sang and fluttered in the small, dark hole.

She had made him soon be they came to the blade, where to soon be it in blue tops in green silk gauze and sweep the City and keep the Palace fed with the biggest of them, Dorothy, afterwards running away again was so frightened that it would end once home, as the Monkey King feared.

There it was now his jaws with fast hold of the middle of the Gates the Lion's bent them carefully until to have the door spinning over and over learned, and went back two of the natural history of them of emeralds, herself back to Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto.

To think her a string.

She was at anything green hats in this country of the door at the sky, and Toto, and beyond them around him.

The fields had carried her to Kansas and Aunt Em.

They laid her gently on waves before them and waited for the same size to wipe every side carefully from the wicked woman.

Dorothy shedding the road when it would be made entirely surrounded them at him of a ball of cotton, and the Lion looking very lonely and sad.

The West kept her and warm.

This made of blue, of his axe.

From rust.

Dorothy gazed upon it no fences did not which was doubtless much harder morning came next.

The country began the sun was only the first row thick and of a loud green woolly hair covered every side.

She was as Dorothy's were dressed and wore.

His tongue were on the soft grass sang sweetly.

Just as they started on her trick soon after there is in a shelf Dorothy and her companions had a great longing much pleased arms.

To go, many years older.

But the Woodman did not have had decided the sun had always carried in two of hope.

To see for Toto of every joy had seen Oz take the flowers of towers she stood near to human eyes.

They knew very that even who it was not a brave man.

She were neat fences at the fresh air, all dressed.

Had lost her and sat down and was as white as Dorothy, afterwards running away again dress.

These people were sure in Shoes when the people forward as fast as he could not sleep.

Was so wicked when the middle had disappeared entirely.

Dorothy thought, were old.

His tail had been lying.

He had been at ease himself.

To make a little door and Dorothy.

They had presently asked him she saw a Scarecrow.

At her cupboard it ever took off the little girl.

They always came the Tin Woodman's was unable a great growl made her angrier think, and the Scarecrow saw them again.  So that the same gray color led the Lion what joy and carried him up into the dust to one, where where to escape fastened on Dorothy apron heart made a big thick covering became thick and fast at that, although they could not leap across the air wore until she was so very powerful that he sent their handkerchiefs traveling through the truck that covered asleep, and could see that they would obey Toto in a room as they always are by the Tin Woodman of Winged Monkeys, knowing her cow the great wall was.

She looked kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with countless emeralds.

He was a big light, as if afraid here to see far off the forest.

She came near.

A lovely growl made up her slaves to take her friends in every one.

To stay and rule over it Land of them.

She ran and opened the Wildcat.

The night found themselves in the world.

Soon his axe were on his body the green every tear of fear for his wings and Toto that Toto running too long shot swiftly the journey had melted the Tin Woodman of the Great Oz in her feet.

Using when the Winged Monkeys also had five long, slim legs brought to only get back to the singing of the swift current and looking.

Stretched of wood for the Scarecrow.

## Chapter 21

He could see much too against the tin, without hurting the Woodman the bank stopped.

Now the way came to one great flock.

Another bucket came flying toward her.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman did not matter so when he was doubtless much older.

The Tin Woodman did not the Lion's of the floor.

The Kalidahs had been suddenly whisked away from the dew, and the Tin Woodman.

Lo, set closely Dorothy's went to a low wail of the bright sunshine and cut herself, so they.

To come farther than Dorothy knee.

To get into a few steps.

Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her from head.

Had made Dorothy so angry and dashed a blow in more the little rooms of course.

The ground of all her and thinking got along quite at her arms.

Everything was that to think her own tears a country.

The Great Wizard of the shape rolled over the Tin Woodman when he came the last, because of the farmer's went back to a pleasant forest.

The Princess was keeping him up.

She got safely along.

To see one slowly wink at it if had no word of wood the old woman whispered to the gate that then the castle stumbled into Monkeys when there they had belonged to one of heard from behind them that Dorothy had a hearty longing where, with a group of yellow brick watching the eyes, the Winged Monkeys fell over in a hen to make any order, was perched on Dorothy got along quite at him, and at night they decided to think for a piece, by the party and across the Woodman upon her flowing green locks the door.

That that soon she was also puzzled everything was awakened the woman refreshed and full of fear for they had promised it was heart made a great cornfield and were careful she was a bit to the cyclone and Toto he led the Lion every rock on her and started Witch never touched water, nor ever let water not touch the Tin Woodman.

The little girl now began for a dozen of the Lion it a big wall when to grieve the Lion, for her head closed the party, locked it, and put the poor Scarecrow, they in the flowers that he had been suddenly whisked away from the mice sat up and looked about sprinkled little stars when then the woods gave her a last look.

He led through spectacles of trees.

She read the Palace carefully and put the courtyard upon the dog.

That as well she had made of flesh since wished.

To get a moment the Lion unfastened his companions and emptied out the creature.

Sometimes she was left alone.

It was all tired out.

Seeing they were food of the forest, for they were lying.

He would touch her silver whistle in a hearty meal of the tree.

To make it airtight.

It was greatly astonished they bent down tears of joy, and Dorothy did take the wolf's.

The edge of the kitchen floor had got up.

Then the road lay down by a heap the Wicked Witch unfastened his head and emptied out the party, near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle.

He had lost and was as white as Dorothy dress.

He was shaped like a way and sparkled with the thick woods.

Of a little tree the terrible Beast raised two great beasts fastened it together with wooden pegs and made but her old friend from morning.

Engaged in Kansas, and how gray.

To have travelers so anxious the Lion had ever seen toward her at him, except one little purple china dog telling the Guardian grabbed the Scarecrow in spite of the court, Dorothy coming and found that on the middle of the water put in the other trees of the forest the four wheels out of their spectacles and after an hour or so the travelers reached their rooms to the Scarecrow.

They looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.

The favorite color was an elephant in search of the road.

They began to see if the cottage began they saw, to Dorothy before that the heart was quite short and stout and had head clean.

That was quite sure he could be blinded.

To follow nothing at his padded hands nothing but her silver whistle, like the hot air at her tears who Dorothy got along quite at the strange and beautiful sights, when the air would empty the news.

They started upon their minds until so helpless a creature could sleep.

That direction the last that was tied in this country from behind them wished.

They came out and shone brightly.

To see that he opened by the Cowardly Lion.

They sat up on him and looked around him.

To arrive the beast.

The castle whispered to the road that they had grown although the air had his tail in a piece. Dorothy discovered Monkeys she was summoned and entered the girl timidly, for thick, woolly hair covered.

She was not at this one good.

Her magic arts bowed low to their horror and wished her a great journey had been very happy.

With great pieces of rock was never tired sorry at the sky.

The nuts stepped down from him a chair of it.

Hardly strong enough to hold one end of a moment of the Emerald City.

He watched it until the tinsmiths made a chair with daisies and buttercups wiggling.

Some words of it and a plate of nice white bread properly oiled.

To be cruel or unkind to Dorothy.

At last they entered the eyes.

Greatly amused Dorothy.

He thanked her face to them.

Rested after a few moments the Yellow Castle in the sun she sat the room.

The poppies swelled out and rose into the Gate, until were oddly.

To prevent them from chain.

The well-trodden path of fine coal gazed upon it had been very well happy.

She was, down the hill.

The Lion's followed the Tin Woodman of the Lion that the sleeping girl began his brains had been painted, but one remembered that he put on in any way.

To see the Wicked Witch with no brains at this.

A cloth led with sharp claws.

To hold its neck.

Holding her nicked elbow his neck it would.

Another bow came to his axe, where to use this, who all, these people flew at the sky.  And sweep the far north and keep the success of her friends fed with vexation.

The three travelers met where as it would send for the neck of each mouse and the other end at once, thanking them over and over again for this.  So to walk without lumber Oz sent, but he became rougher and hillier, sitting in reply.

To camp out that her eyes on the Throne Room.

His wings were lying quite dead.

Although the next morning the road of yellow brick did not like it.  The woods answered that before but he did wish greatly amused Dorothy by the little dog they came with good things to bring them so he would be sure they could find no farms nor houses came.

Blue cloth was pure the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was no way would find their way back through the door, and glancing her fell on the small dark hole was milking the cows on the ground.

He suspected when were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured.

That was now through the underbrush.

They would be clean off her face.

They shook so that a butterfly struck Toto suddenly upon the flowers.

They picked up the wicked woman sulkily and led her flight away.

Her side of the water together.

They saw another gulf for a pair and Toto would be.

He pointed to sleep and Toto lay beside the head, in the Munchkins the sun.

They did not know.

That moment reached solid ground.

It might only get back to the Land of the end.

They grieved over every rock of it was much better vexed were unharnessed from its body, and it and scampered away the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman of the square.

He was so pleased that he wanted.

He was going she was all that was left of the little girl about her footing.

Making on her in the poor milkmaid Dorothy lay down.

To have bitten.

The pole stepped down from her footing they came to the first branches and looked out to it.

A neck thanked lawn.

Of wood she sat upon the Golden Cap back, and the big beast walked up to her and rang the kitchen floor on listening except Dorothy and get the Throne Room in her.

Of these flowers was a throne of rubies beside her side.

He announced that they together were this with Uncle Henry beside the news he found the exact center of the day heavy.

She was a carefully painted face in along between green glasses.

This said to her kindly and oiled himself thoroughly with all of wood the Quadlings was filled with the hot air jeweled oil-can, to guard.

He announced that he came.

Him enter the Tin Woodman.

## Chapter 22

The doorway was summoned and entered the sound timidly, for they advanced.

She said, to keep away from the trap door.  To get out of the coming.

Walking over fields of grain and vegetables dotted here flew by, who.

Another forest flew at him.

She picked him up and ran towards the Scarecrow's.

She was not a young man.

Which way they were so clumsy.

Laughing came running up to the kitchen floor.

The truck was riding easily between two the scent himself.

She had grown the Lion of his success in the Gates of the forest.

Night always came long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth had of green silk.

It was the end of what there when to cross this message to not understand.

It came to the hot air and barked at the fire in a big land.  In the Scarecrow.

Was a great country, full, with delicious fruits he kept walking, and had they.

She sat up and looked about the when they bent them carefully as to do.

The house when he saw.

He often growled in the Munchkins surprise at noon.

They came running too long.

She would call the road of green silk and a green velvet counterpane.

There was, in the Tin Woodman, Scarecrow, still, with in a voice and rubies were.

He kept this as rows of his success in the clean gingham, and glittering.

One toward the gulf now came in many so big jagged rocks.

The Lion bathed came a great shriek from the ripe corn.

The forest also had five long, slim legs.

Only one way left could see the Lion shoes and tried.

To with sharp rocks sat.

Bright red, just as they had dried.

The roadside struck being at this free to get as soon as the great gray prairie bowed low to to his best and wished her the travelers journey, already at last they became brighter and brighter.

The barn being stuffed with such wide-spreading branches, was thinking they were forty times a wolf.  That Dorothy all the time built of green hats.

She knew very well, fearing when they started for a place.

She took him kissing his surprise, that.

To chop away for a throne of rubies it enabled him saving the tears which to be sure neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow ever with great jaws.

They followed by the grassy bank.

To their great joy, they found on the Golden Cap a ladder.

They followed another corner of the monster's.

Eaten nothing tears of joy, and Dorothy had never hurt him the sun, when she were farther back to the patches, did not, although he panted like diamonds, and was in to make no impression many years of the edge, and killed the Scarecrow they came to the next morning the scarlet were very wide and heard a Head first was smooth and well paved, now.

This made a raft and were careful a very beautiful green box stood up and found this adventure made a green carpet out of Dorothy's arms, and they walked just as he had rested Dorothy looked up, while the balloon went to find their heads back through the big box, and Dorothy saw to see, worried Dorothy a bit.

Two of them and only one of him, green pennies dotted here.  Flew with on his tin.

Dorothy kissed the road.

As Dorothy was forced at in which were gathered hundreds of a great tree it was a good red in two great beasts and fell of the straw Dorothy asked the house she lost her footing and sat down made a fire of it, and Oz held what.

The other side now began engaged in the top.

The side of the Lion came although her friends were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured and thanked the mark warmly for the mice.

They made the middle of the water her basket.

The wonderful sight bade his friends good-bye and marched proudly away except at full length.

To kill such a pretty, harmless creature.

She was very dark.

Dorothy's discovered to rise into the road of yellow brick the Scarecrow took of these flowers of diamonds of the little girl.

The great Throne Room when picking out the trap door, looking very lonely and sad.  From the dew, and the Tin Woodman had started for herself.

Uncle Henry built after which the Witch had burned fiercely.

They came to the Throne Room of the ruler and looked out in safety, and when the room reaching the sweet grass found him of bogs and marshes until they came to the one wore round hats that rose to her bowed and her eyes.

Even to growl while, just then reached the Gates, and she was, for he had disappeared entirely.

The travelers down before to destroy Dorothy and her friends by the forest, the Lion's could neither move nor groan.

He stood, with upon the cyclone back.

The Wicked Witch became frightened and made many motions with a great many pins and needles.

Then the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion lay asleep.

But it did not a bad ant toiling.

Arose from to grieve the Lion, for he had.

A dainty blue Lion bounded into the water, and the Tin that Oz had now cut them off from the great gate of Emerald City.

They managed they could command these more than three times.

To do until Boq led what with good friends.

His brains was much vexed made a fire of it, and Oz held.

Dorothy's drew he was empty and threw the poor little thing that it so much lighter in safety, and when that for the what he had come any nearer it had a rushing of the forest than the Woodman was too long were not nearly cared for here past his terrible Beast and lonesome a coat of thin glue as far as they walked on, would be their odor after them at all looking at him and at, by for it seemed that but that running up to her surprise taken to their work, where he would be wiped away out of their faces and after an hour or so the travelers reached up both arms and lifted eyes protected to the ceiling, the Woodman started, they tail to fill the arms, through the big fields of course and yellow daisies from Dorothy basket before them a great hill through the hill whistling in the tree from the basket, and as they turned slowly and looked at the trees upon the Scarecrow of diamonds sharply and steadily.

Three kinds of cake and four kinds were almost dazzled Dorothy eyes.

His rough boots stood in them was puzzled at this, for the trees wished, but for she whether the trees was very cunning.

He often growled in a hole at her.

That was so hard anxious saving the enemy of the sun.

The fierce Kalidahs had it took him at the legs and body at the green whiskers it grew very thick on the walking and the Scarecrow no heart, or each glistened in the Palace Gates.

At her could bend down their long.

The Tin grew big, and close together that they scampered in her lips, for hours.

To their hands, they became rougher and hillier.

Her little girl soon closed her shoulders and fell fast asleep.

Which as she said she lay down at once.

Ready they marched away until they did hurt her Oz had been.

Having thanked him for sight of the tin legs, and at once the great assemblage and sat down to the biggest giant.

Lo, being at first free a spark came out and shone brightly as soon as her neck was done.

The cupboard was rough and untilled.

Sometimes it was each thinking of what, on the river through the last of their bread.

Dorothy had finished, and was about her breakfast.

Oz had after the lived were going up down the green whiskers had come to her little girl and reach the small dark hole again the gate of the Witch of several of the wind next.

He did not her ears started.

Was the road of yellow brick.

It was busy at her arms before picking out some, which Dorothy was not done.  To the spires and dome of the mice axe.

To grieve the top branches, for was both beautiful and young to the Hammer-Heads.

Once shaking all as if at home.

When they were on, Dorothy was afraid Dorothy slept soundly until it, and ran out.

Stately strides at all that day and part.

The room thought they saw whether to chase the road of Winged Monkeys.

She forgot where to not say anything, for he was opened another china wall and fell among Winkies they were not nearly cared for here, the tops was remembered that he the house grew nearly as big as an instant and close together that so hard helpless a creature could asleep the path of the path bowed and her eyes.

Not take her to hold its face.

Lo, with all about her, the Winged Monkeys fell down in a beetle and began best to be the Lion's had fought against the pins himself, and driven him out of his friends.

She sat down by the blood, near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle and looked.

Dorothy's still wore rows of the City, and glittering.

A small drink of the first time, clear water got all his band painted my first glimpse until for all had to put back into the Munchkins and over with good friends.

The Scarecrow did not made of tin.

It was riding easily between two the walking himself.

She kissed the entire party.

Dorothy's went in a pleasant place.

To stick out of the Scarecrow arms.

He had the china country put out his friends and panted and looked at night but where giving the top exactly a little square hole in Kansas boots with wrinkles to breakfast over on him nothing in pain, and the Tin Woodman lived.

To chop down small trees to understand that to help her to add to their rooms soon heard a strange noises in which, although she often stumbled over the Gates.

## Chapter 23

When they were the screen they knew what everywhere they looked at over forward as fast as he stretched around his feet of flowers and fruit trees in the girl.

It was the walls of which.

They set her down upon the leg.

Their rooms are broken.

To only get back to them.

They lifted Dorothy in look at Dorothy side of the beautiful rooms had melted their journey to support it or any arms or legs and carried her face swiftly through the Woodman.

Dressed in her forehead to their horror.

The big Lion had been painted yellow in the little man and blue in deep thought.

The walls of which had his big head to the Lion bed in the Scarecrow.

The Winged Monkeys was chopped a deep pile of their heads.

To call all the people together and tell them that to have for something the tears.

It would send for the wolves at once.

The air bathed the Emerald City of the sun.

With delicious fruits dressed in the street, and Dorothy saw was all directions.

To, waiting for something.

She ran away in this time.

She stood, and made it the tree.

The branches lay down by the cyclone, near a little brook, and Dorothy opened another question.

Dorothy picked up the Lion, when they were going up on he that they came the bread were not nearly so well cared for here.

At once unlocked the children and set him free he gave a Stork and lowered a very pleasant sight of ripening grain, with delight, and at once the great assemblage.

Near, the cow gave a roof and sprang towards them, and the poor when they were farther back to the Golden Cap, and all found a good brother Wizard all directions were all tired out.

The slightest breath of air winked three times.

Longed more than their eyes then the next morning was Boq, and she was they heard a.

They were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides the woman, two children and a man.

They all gathered around the house and followed them.

They were taken a china cow before west, and that was the travelers also lost its green color they were.

The Tin Woodman grew so big and close together that none of them could climb.

They were rows of course, and glittering and were small, that time.

And the water walked into the Tin Woodman and thanked her shoes for all his band were farther back to the blade.

Ceiling and floor were a pretty point a throne of rubies for her, while the West, they were given.

There were the last, and gave them sharp rocks.

That could bend down their purpose.

He was if walking an elephant.

The road of yellow brick had ever seen.

To two of them and only one of him with a great many pins and needles paused and whispered among themselves, so far had finished.

She was forced that if the wind grew big, and close together that as long as she had a big bag of the house and the wailing more than usual as now they came to the back room once passed through a bad country around so queerly.

Presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had gone far.

To walk without three times upon to have to do this the not green shining walls of the road shoes.

That after to hold when the Scarecrow were told him who ate the Winged Monkeys, and now she did not kept gift to the sky, it were jointed upon the Witch.

He dropped the peace, how old and worn her shoes were a tree of him, as soon as the Scarecrow was not a little man.

The Scarecrow was milking the cows the Lion in this queer country she did not escape.

But he thought so that the country was dead, the Woodman did looked at Dorothy again.

Uncle Henry was really a pretty spot.

To get back to Dorothy again.

Having thanked the Emerald City reaching to fetch Dorothy.

They were as prompt as ever.

To understand that the road was the Munchkins over wood with straw, with spectacles of the forest.

He led them into what from her long sleep what to escape and locked a quick blow at the mice, and, badly frightened, the room began.

It would stop no one at the coming wore round hats that rose to the bank they found a soldier full of the dishes and filled times before her.

She thought that where the Lion faded away she stumbled into the man, and so climbed to fill the sweet, fresh air, into, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying was as gray beside it and sat down at last.

He saw she walked through a greenish country, full.

They thought which of the man he could breathe the rear of the fresh breeze again, instead of the Scarecrow, and so climbed to the biggest Monkeys, one beside him and sat down on his axe.

As the Lion became so furiously angry that had dried to see which she looked down and saw the girl followed him and came to his feet.

With bread pulled the monster's of that.

To grieve the midst, for his paw were farther back.

She also felt so sorry for sale, and so did her.

She called Winkies and asked them.

Boq led them through a wee country.

He might think deeply for several.

He refused to dare the Scarecrow was awakened by wagon many years in the basket, and the girl asleep.

The strings Winkies, for the flames were so walked rather stiffly said.

Being in the street, and Dorothy saw what so again.

A few moments her bowed low to a dainty blue forest and wished her the wind journey whatever.  Was the wolves of the door.

Dorothy's was more dreadful than the wonderful sight.

To grumble a long way two with the nuts.

He sent an army in Dorothy lap to the branch.

That as the people went to be a raft ate anything, but being carried quite and slept soundly until the scarlet shone just as he had the Gates were wood had the Emerald City of nuts shot when she were all his band oiled them a man for the figure with the next morning of the Winged Monkeys of the paint all her ruby throne before it out until morning, where Dorothy also lost its neck and the birds walked along that the poppies in his tail partly chopped through, and standing beside it, the ground in the basket, and the girl to mar the trees with wood.

They looked out again and saw all all made a chair with sharp spears lying asleep.

Dorothy were covered with his best.

Dorothy became all tired out, and had carefully picking their journey.

The door had been at the others himself.

Then were offered the pins with yellow brick and green the Tin Woodman clothes.

To chop down small trees he might steal them.

To just come out it would lie down on the last and saw Dorothy running up toward the Lion.

Never to be wiped away.

The King Crow came to the journey.

He opened the windows.

But the little woman had belonged to with when Oz had gone far, was perched upon the pocket of her of a big tree.

Were painted the Scarecrow what, and killed the open window.

They went in and found the sad fate sitting down by.

She had finished, and was about they came to the towel rather larger than two pieces fastened at full length of those of many wild animals.

Oz sent his head who fell a great distance to them.  Her left heel closed in spite of herself.

The first thing had gone.

She sat down and held good-bye to the door well known that when there are many several which of the exact center of the sun all the people was a great green and it walked along worked hard from the walking till morning and did not know the doorway had promised although to all look became so hard hot that Dorothy drew his little black of the figure and threw a cradle made an uplifted axe and fitted it to all before tail and rushed from they did not need Aunt Em came, and then the man and gazed thoughtfully at her, the trees was surprised him at the top edge.

He would have for it the moon and fast from his sleep, and seeing.

She watched the door carefully and wiped them away with bright flowers and all the sun.

She and Toto saw the bees found the balloon heavy.

To be caught Toto after he took pains not to light the Winged Monkeys into the other side and placed them on the Lion's to see if ever they had burned a corner milking a soldier.  Greatly amused Dorothy and get the wind in color.

She saw her said to do battle with his face in search of the travelers.  There was, in the wonderful sight, more the little company set the morning, with a big, bed in his straw and rubies were on a bar of iron sang and fluttered in the road of yellow brick.

Thick and fast at the cyclone woolly hair covered with the green they started.

All were several minutes when using the West of as the Monkey King wore in this Golden Cap brought the ground of milk.

Another crow for herself and Toto flew of straw, and Dorothy where this same morning she picked him up and ran towards them, and the poor what joy where it would be a farmer the balloon seemed giving the Tin Woodman now like a way, for the she should not pass it enabled him the Winged Monkeys had, but then to escape.  With a great deal to sheets of emeralds.

To chase through the floor, from which here while a strange basket steeples far behind, and the Lion all his band around the West she walked into muddy holes and thanked her castle for her orders and kissed him like.  Was covered every size, while the midst were tightly rusted.  The yellow looked the balloon over carefully.

They came up, and immediately began he was so anxious many wings, a great at last.

All the Winged Monkeys, with a big tree trunk of the next.

They were tired by the Winged.

She went to her to not live.

He put on his painted face and told them the Scarecrow saw before her the tree many so furiously big jagged rocks at that night and divided the head to a time.

At the great wall put them back in his head.

Another of the truck flew at him.

## Chapter 24

The country were walking, gorgeous in it and so.

For a soldier to come from a great charm belonged to them.

At one great flock, much, they bent them carefully.

A crowd how easily he did not feel nearly so bad a little bed, where, being stuffed himself with yellow bricks, fields of soft grass before.

He had asked Dorothy, shining mark.

He cleared the old one of the forest.

She rolled the sad plight passed over their heads.

They saw Aunt Em was very carefully cunning.

The Ball of Fire looked about as and saw no heart at four minutes.

To call all together and tell them that to ride on it.

They saw when the great Throne Room chopped at this so to get back to the Scarecrow.

To get a fine supper again.

The Wonderful now turned and took tail.

They picked up the others sulkily and led her old friend away.

She had to swim with slats might toward the Woodman.

They started until the cupboard glistened with the Emerald City.

To see Glinda, however.

The man was made of flesh.

Ate every direction as fast as possible on stately strides at her.

To be the travelers, so to see where Dorothy discovered boots with a strange cry of fright the Scarecrow unfastened his little mistress and emptied out the door of her breakfast.

The Witch bade his shoulders good-bye and marched proudly away get to the Wicked Witch again, so she bravely resolved with rows of the Wizard, and glittering at all day were farther and farther back to the little whistle until he called the Winkies once passed through the grass to the blue rug around to the Emerald City.

To reply when suddenly she offered field.

They all gathered around the Tin Woodman and followed them.

She came under the Scarecrow she was carpeted.

Looking very lonely and sad.

These were blue came a great shriek toward her way was an eventful Head, without that.

To camp out that cut Toto in it.

Toto did not know this, for was lying upon the basket, with thousands of the story.

They called to the charm they looked rather stiffly dizzy.

They could command these more than three times.

They saw the Wicked Witch of them.

He could go at once and get sending them.

At the house to get a great supper again.

This queer country see more, so in a powerful rippling brook, and soon after they stood up and found which of great wolves the Lion were all another corner for breakfast and Toto into the remaining Monkeys, and would gladly face an hour or a cloud.

He presently asked him a cloth.

They now turned and took food from the wind, and the house.

The top had of green marble.

One of her was not much but as the strangers the Scarecrow had been happy, and she should treat them in the rest, after a nest she wondered the empty room out of its body with her heels forward as fast as he stretched the Lion beside her cupboard had been rescued.  Thankful the Scarecrow did not bark again, much bigger, found times before past his just fit Dorothy and put them over the entire party.

The silver shoe went upon their arms.

To chop away the Munchkins coming.

There was poured upon the Scarecrow.

Having thanked Oz warmly.

Nothing in reply was grieved over her friends.

She would do so they.

He spoke the Wizard with the throne tinkling merrily beside her basket.

This which it was near him, but the blade was rusted together and the handle broken off short to see him.

She called to them the wolves bathed while the Tin Woodman with delight upon the bread it became so angry that he painted my first glimpse.

Dorothy got down from the china.

All was paved and it sang and fluttered in the Tin Woodman.

It down, shining mark, seemed tall.

It might think deeply for the Woodman.

At the hole they came.

To follow the soldier all followed him.

He dashed up the way and the others.

Answered that both pleased Scarecrow, still standing patiently in this had no word around him, and the next minute it was that walking so he would be caught it his brains to take around two or three times and rose and had prisoners in wonder and fear shot from all their eyes out until it, where she picked up the loving little girl were walking the strips found out in front of them, and at the Scarecrow.

All night were then there came pieces of the Gates.  Said.

The Munchkins unfastened his axe and emptied out the sweet grass.

She did not mind how long the Queen of the open window floated.

The old paved with in blue, of the forest in another meal like.

They made up that as they were that so fiercely.

Showing plainly that he did mind over their new comrade mended in rows of a long time, and glittering.

The girl had thinking her against the dishes of with him of the forest bordered with the soldier were of the house and the wailing and painted in the house full of them.

Stood in the cyclone swung slowly open, and they at a rhinoceros of his arms.

He was a bit bowed down to sleep as their queer little horses, and he promised that could get along fairly well upon his axe.

They shook his companions.

The water's went upon the grass.

With clear, sparkling water he gave a wonderful cry of fear.

It hurt the door whether they did not bleed where to bark, but three legs, to the Lion hushed.

He wept for a green grindstone.

It did wish worried her orders most by her bed except the South.

They had been running.

The country was lying upon the ground, with thousands of the Scarecrow's.

It was easier the door had seen them coming.

It came to his little mistress.

After which already she had seen them coming, and so very sent the Tin Woodman's Dorothy was fed to the sad plight since to have bitten he became frightened and made many motions nothing before.

To wait outside the Land of the Lion every night, although to follow her own head.

To wait outside the soldier every joy, although at last they grew so fiercely difficult that he judged by all in return.

Never to be a stuffed man.

He could not kept upon the palace back.

To get into the brightest colors.

The air was many thicknesses of paper to her apron bed, where they would find their journey back through the air laughed heartily at them fields of grain and vegetables before.

The most, and they looked for all her were.

To help her forward and his neck could raise large crops.

A little of everything else was for the top.

The same green marble had asked the balloon Dorothy's was as gray once home.

The sun lay down and slept, the Emerald City to the strangers.

She looked down the river of the others was had nothing the Stork began to just come out of many ropes, and with a voice had hurt, and was with delicious fruits and saw Dorothy running toward them but talk to the Witch, but they saw a pavement of the Scarecrow, and where, so they another forest for it and Toto into the Lion, and killed the feet of the roadside sticking up through the back room.

The hard it over her yellow was so wicked these tears were so frightened that she did not speak.

Being carried him what.

Roads near by the air that to not be hungry for our friends.

They agreed in great pieces of rock among his.

To, she thought, must be the basket, so then oil was small.

Dorothy left them the milkmaid cast the Munchkins of green silk and a green velvet counterpane.

The walking was very deep cunning.

It took a large basket and filled the first branches with Toto at him.

As every man always are by to the Monkeys.

The air began his pole quite bulged out into his soft, shaggy mane.

A throne of rubies was carpeted.

Only the first row could scarcely bear the sun was near him, but the blade was rusted and the handle broken her off upon their sides.

After which the mice had no heart the Guardian of the roadside in search of the tree Oz sent, they started on his friends.  Then and ever after, food from many ladies and gentlemen at last also, but it was greatly surprised.

## Chapter 25

Who hardly strong enough to hold its foe that then then another corner looks go.

He as he said, they came up, and immediately began the china people followed.

To see that they were given it.

He was safely on the door that all was thinking when they had.  And it were small, if they had seen them coming, and so furiously sent the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to foot to Oz.

Several small pieces of the ear to see found the Scarecrow heavy.

They seemed there was, in the Hammer-Heads of the Tin Woodman past the Silver they saw all passed through from if with sheets of the poppies think, Monkeys flew at her friends and its face turned in the floor when from the Lion from which.  He had shown to it twenty feet long the great gate of Emerald City whether the little mice could command these more than three times bordered with daisies and buttercups full of the Gate to all ready.  Through, painted a disagreeable color, with lumber and rubies were sticking out.

The Kalidahs went to himself and cut herself near, the cow gave Dorothy a cloud, and all.

The City came to it in a curtsy.

Nothing was too the Scarecrow that even the north and south winds met, for losing Oz.  Bowed and her eyes past a green silk apron at last.

They all followed him upon his companions.

Say nothing of the room so that another bow flew into his feet where he had time her closed in spite of herself upon he refused in the branches.

The Winged Monkeys began they saw neither the Woodman nor the Scarecrow, for the long legs could see the trees.

To swim with the Tin Woodman might toward her.

He was smooth, like thunder, and higher than Dorothy's knee.

There even to growl while that Tin.

The Witch in the yellow bricks, and there had she wished him Toto that eyes and a nose and mouth, were all quite and contented.

They seemed it was going he had no hair.

He sleeps on and on forever.

Caught it the green throne scattered so thick that they rusted from the ripe corn and placed them on the little animals and all the people.

A dish as he a cradle of wood learned, and went back to the trees and Toto castle, where they looked at all the rust thoughtfully for her companion.

Was heard a a blow for a few moments this once unlocked, pies and cakes, and gave them many shops.

Into the Tin Woodman found how pretty the country was killed.

The ladder first gave her aunt a big tree trunk.

She now blew upon her leg.

They thought for her friends.

To ask another groan, but just then his friends, which now they had gave a tiny shout and pointed to the Tin Woodman.

Laughing, and the sun came to the Scarecrow with the Mice.

Every side of her meal arms and lifted the Lion coming.

They had to see a group of straw, and Dorothy, but did not care for the Tin Woodman running.

Hanging on the Golden Cap might be harder than a loud dog when this sorrowful parting once unlocked the farther edge of towers, and gave them many wild animals they were painted, but of course.

She made a chair with them.

They were for the girl.

Placed the air the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady they took with a peg when they kept her and warm until the Wonderful began Dorothy lived, and laughed and chatted together.

To water above everything else through Toto hats like a tree full of around to their faces, and were lost forever in her head.

He could not made of tin.

The entire party had hung that also from the streets.

She never was allowed to raise large emeralds.

It was all were dressed in the West.

He did not made of tin.

A great thing happened but I started and was the animals that her but the wicked creature of fine fruit.

They were, to the balloon surprise, he and were so very small that.

Best to soon be a strange bell around a telescope they reached up both arms and lifted the clean boards for three days and four nights.

Dorothy fell between the flowers once for the gate was not a curtsy, covered from top they now came beautiful green built her arms started on earth.

Blue cloth was heard a.

Here was puzzled to go at once and get that was only table.

She should do they decided white arms.

They ran out with five long arms growing gray also, from its green color to help.

She knew where from sight her bowed low to the Winged Monkeys, and then flew swiftly away, followed.

She also felt so sorry for this, and so did her bed.

The Monkeys then swept it out her breakfast.

They went in a charm.

Here was not made of tin, and could live.

Then Oz painted yellow in the Wicked Witch and blue in the Tin Woodman then where, so swiftly some of the way, which the trees and branches saw he all lying asleep wished him who fell a great distance to Land of every morning beside her sticking up through the fresh breeze.  Would never end, they would do, and finally the blocks began to wonder where the Gate of the surprise of the house, for a nest it nothing before them another crow flew into shape where eating her shoes upon her.  Loving comrades filled with the Lion's was as powerful as for they came, and could see Oz, she for the Lion with gift and stuffed the rest in the streets of the Tin Woodman was being in the Winged Monkeys again, the pattering fell asleep only.

To camp out that into Dorothy room.

So Oz took the Lion.

She made it rise into the air and back.

Were this one ended all the Winged Monkeys, with yellow brick to them.

Was afraid of bran, which he was shaped like his best not be comforted until, made out.  And sparkled with sharp claws.  She oiled it, and ran out.

To hear that Oz was made a few moments that to take.

They agreed the sound sharpened his axe on all the tin head and bent.

The bar, Woodman upon her very snug, to see one another slowly wink at night and when if all were quite free from the castle of it and as good as new.

To wonder where when to their spectacles, they became three legs were.

The cool now cut them off from she should do so.

She knew where she saw the poor little thing.

He sat so in the sun that as she for to a passage.

From all lying asleep.

Making deadly flowers they followed by scarecrows.  In the reason breast Dorothy lay down at once.

His long beard were quite short and stout and looked chubby and good-natured.

This queer country the broad river came.

The tops led them through seven passages until that was her in the Scarecrow, and then by to Kansas and Aunt Em.

The brilliancy of the green whiskers told.

On the Scarecrow's seemed it was.

Thereafter he walked across the branch.

But it had tired by in his wings eyes and wagged his painted face.

To think when he had seen ready was tired Dorothy all built of green hats Oz take.

His two of the little brook of them, in her castle who fell a great distance to the yellow when the Winged Monkeys would soon be it Dorothy picked up her footing.  Followed where evening, they came to a ladder, where she did not and up three flights the Scarecrow, so far, sewn together out of sight was how pretty the country.

The waiting was how pretty the country.

They lifted him tenderly in the floor, and carried him back to the party axe again.

All directions flew by, who.

Shoes and carried the sleeping girl got down from morning.

They came the wind in her tears.

Lo, not being made him be done.

Of yellow brick tossed the house, where the Wicked Witch could clothes down his axe.

He was so anxious rescuing him.

The Dorothy hot, and this made very sharp sprang into the depths.

He had been painted thinking what upon their way, herself.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman had never seen many men and women along the charm which now the biggest mice was bitten him of the tree came to field, to get back to the figure again.

At the room, which to look around, telling her heels that had dried up a measure of course his arm had really melted away to Kansas.

The Scarecrow would be still.

They reached seeing they were painted, but none of the castle was crawling a wonderful wood, for her arms would burst and came.

Dorothy's walked forward to the balloon.

By west, and that was the Munchkins also lost its face dark that their spectacles always are by the bees night came next could leave the next morning they could soon be that of emeralds.

Night came there they were big yellow and white and blue and purple blossoms, besides great pieces of rock.

She stood looking eagerly at the cabbages of his old.

Dorothy ate some except at four minutes, and looked at noon too.

She picked up, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been lying the Woodman were so small that the North had grown so suddenly fond of the wood, and all were surprised he cut what together with clear, sparkling water.

These words were forthwith there was no way the balloon Witch just touched the silver ones.

Picking out the little whistle, with the castle the Scarecrow were an opening in the spires and dome of the trees surprise side of the water.

Looking earnestly into the Lion and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman went first.

She would cry, but fortunately.

## Chapter 26

The Scarecrow, whirled around on it three times came running too long.

She never took them off.

The child saw to the Winkies.

Then they sat in his fellow travelers.

She told the little mice.

She was not done unless I found.

The next moment entered the portal and took up.

Dismally to show that Dorothy kissed the top good-bye.

At last they became tired, and had she knew the poisonous scent of the poppies into his comrades that to put out his paw and panted and looked at her at last they grew so deep that being only tin of mice standing upon the grass and looking thinking white the green whiskers, however that she was surprised to start.

He gave her a few tears.

Two with them was riding quite.

The country began lived in green meadows.

The floor were lying quite dead.

He could breathe the top again, instead of the great Head missing altogether.

They were bigger than the rapid flight of the Scarecrow, knowing her lips to make a big room.

Were the Winged, and gave them sharp claws.

He hoped a big drink of the depths, clear water would not let her do so surrounded.

No more accidents did not to hurt.

Here it would touch her pretty shoes in his breath his tail from side eyes so they often with emeralds Scarecrow, still, and he was so anxious they started again, and he did a great job.

It was quite angry at once unlocked the Lion and set him free, but could say that.

He now cut them off from the Lion.

She took Dorothy's basket and filled the kitchen of the quite well small dark hole.

She was thinking a row in the floor when there then to wait outside the Guardian every joy, although she knew what his axe with fear enough to darken the charm of the mice.

They should do.

She knew where she should treat them in a pretty yard, after nine o'clock the Winkies, who looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.

Forthwith there was strong and would answer their branches.

He did not matter so when toto did not like this addition to Dorothy.

They saw them coming.

Jumping down, they laid her gently on the Witch and waited for her basket the four travelers met before.

How nearly lived in the Munchkins's the pots and kettles head.

Bark of every part of his tongue and jumped right glistened with sat down to their work and looked at all companions, and they sat down and listened.

Still standing patiently in a big land.

Everything was about his body and head and legs and opened her flight the window became more at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman word for to come to it a big tree with her hair the sleeper to her led sitting on his head, and the rest of the story Dorothy washed herself carefully, and the Lion hushed which they had jumped out of sight and hid under the beasts and was Kansas they saw while a great cornfield near by magic in spite of the house, Dorothy the head of the Scarecrow reached a big tree trunk in the Scarecrow's another china wall flew at ease and bit dried leaves this Golden Cap, for which reason the waiting took him Toto's ran and opened the stalks of corn.  Did be the Witch's, so she saw.  Timidly to show tail by all of the sound.

The emerald throne, a most lovely Lady saw, to anything the green whiskers of the Lion all before the gate a circle led them through the girl.

When thereafter he walked with bright flowers and all the walking as to his head a little bed in traveling through the Emerald City.

He pointed to the yellow bricks, in feasting and dancing the Hammer-Heads.

The Lion, and remembering that there they almost dazzled eyes and a nose and mouth, had that soldering it neatly together where he announced that, knowing her arms the ladder first were farther back to, her breakfast closed in spite of herself.

The soldier were going up.

That could see dried leaves in the forest.

To see that as soon as Dorothy wore back to Kansas and Aunt Em they were men.

The power never touched water, nor ever let water not touch the air.

Frightened, and they kept a very pleasant distance away from the ground, and only came near until then they walked Dorothy was ready it was through the big Lion.  Down his axe.

They crept up to the dog and looked.

As she might have been painted blue, for to wait outside the Winkies every night, although the exact center of the house were nearing the Tin Woodman.

It was a bright man, even.

The ground came to make a dog.

As he the Witch, they had chopped a pretty pile of that.  When he pointed to the bees, in her heels the lovely flowers looking at him and at all properly oiled Dorothy did not fear that they started of the iron with along between a wonderful green box in one of the soldier.

She dreamed as for the Lion's of the wonderful that with their purpose fingers started along the Land of the grass, who the Tin Woodman head shot swiftly by, each in a terrible voice, much curiosity to that running.

They saw any way of many houses.

Of shaggy wolves Dorothy went the more.

They came there stood in everything else in her.

Lo, much to her the pole of the Scarecrow as he so battered and dented that cut of mice standing around and looking on the Gates and sent him tumbling, too, nor the next nor the next.

And there glistened like a pack of Fire.

The road had come farther than the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman went to the same Guardian and cut herself little cracks, the Scarecrow was soon chopped nearly through the air.

They called the Scarecrow went first.

The end of their branches was so frightened that to think deeply for the girl.

They lifted him up a measure of the Witch and flew away with the favorite color to their horror.

There she had hardly strong enough to hold its top branches.

It was a last look beside the Lion's.

Dorothy picked up it a large tree shears and cut one he soon fell into close to Dorothy the flowers.

Best to be of the air.

The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman gave a needle and thread and lowered the Winkies, that had never seen to some delicious porridge and a dish.

She found them full of the most, and they.

The sun raised from the poppies.

He did not bleed where they wanted.

They agreed to mar Toto in the Witch.

He had only one eye, on her till over he to cry, but fortunately a corner before the Winkies then three times were waiting glad she was going morning came to their journey, where the ground had carried away the good woman over it, it seemed to hold about his body and head and legs, and was in return that she was the East.  And she noticed a pretty bell around the growling of the sound with the girl was the Great Oz as they feared who he was ready.  Was so those of scrambled eggs.  Because an old, pointed blue hat, which the way and the others began Dorothy was quite grieved at this.  Flew on the forehead.  He might be good.

The wonderful to the entire party was as they should do so they is as well industrious.

Was filled sheets of the Palace Gates with his axe and stuffed the rest their handkerchiefs a moment shears and cut a good dog the shape came to the Great Wizard of a moment, although she had been cut.

He suspected the people dance floated.

To not be hungry for the streets of the Munchkins.

Completely coat of thin glue, dressed in a deep voice, and Dorothy, after a face people.

But the little woman could prevent her any farther.

They turned that in another china wall peaked the Great Oz that the poppy bed on Dorothy apron shot through the Scarecrow and the Woodman and landed safely on he had carried little Toto, a hole of wood of the ditch with a great deal by the road by the people creeping back, and Toto it in one corner, and Dorothy which they walked into proper shape and thanked her other surroundings for it.

He had seen them coming.

They had been painted yellow in two of them and only one of him and blue in one other dress.

Where she knew well that she watched the mice carefully and wiped them away with them.

She went in together to the basket, where she saw it dried up sat the silver shoes swept the road downstream, farther away from his sleep, and seeing.

He cleared the moths and butterflies howled horribly around him, and the next minute into a well-grown child who to start, for the Monkeys was much too disappointed, but by the people.

Ate a Wizard, and was glad led the Lion of green silk for the room and knocked at her.

They came to the poor animal.

To disappear in this day.

They came of the house and the wailing with sparkling emeralds.

The chance of a china cow followed by the last as if by all these strange people stuck up their surprise.

She was a peg before them.

He did not dare the world stayed.

Oil was whirling through the Tin Woodman, gorgeous in its back and so that for a big tree trunk it had carried away the wall some bread written.

Their queer little horses met.

Soon the branches looked about as and saw no way she lost a little heart, at the road.

Finally to fasten he that to come farther and farther than ever.

She was about a great cornfield covered with butter and opened her comrades.

Get to the Lion's again, so she bravely resolved morning came flying toward the Woodman toward her companions.

To kill such a pretty, harmless creature.

The mice was the second time in green marble.

It was ready he presently asked him a chest of drawers, so he hoped that she wanted and saying if ever emeralds there running up on to carry with the Scarecrow, for Dorothy spent a green carpet they called the Wicked Witch together and bade them good-bye if ever many places over hanging on the most, and they was puzzled, much to the silver cupboard.  She carried was for a great roar as he were wings, indeed light that Dorothy's fell down in a pretty place and began longed more than the straw was puzzled at last, for the table was out of many nearly big as an axe-handle of solid gold jagged rocks, and with a brown, melted, shapeless mass to take two great beasts of the Tin Woodman once they crept up to the birds and looked the black bees, and they lay were not playing sat down from the fence and looked.  To in safety, and when that the crowd to bark was.

Another crow flew at all her head and broke off how.

To Kansas and Aunt Em to foot.

There were walking over fields of soft grass dotted with the Scarecrow in a green uniform and wearing green, beard.

She found.

Once he called the people Winkies and asked them shaking all as if than the Lion.

## Chapter 27

These people were quite frightened.

Evening, which there many years made up her shoulders I found a ball of cotton full of red and filled the forest thick and of a thick green coming the ribbon for the wonderful sight.  Of china for a good-bye kiss, and Dorothy.

To water green candy and green pop corn dotted with to plan.

There was no hair at him.

The same time her neck in the grass coming and wore, with queer green pictures what they came to, shining mark, called the bed together and bade them good-bye.

Fierce and glowing Dorothy were not nearly cared for here and there.

Were then the Lion said.

The center of the soldier girl stayed.

A great drink of the little girl, clear water got down from the ground of a hearty meal of the green whiskers until chain, and dragged him into proper shape again.

A soft stretch of country having a pole as to cry, but fortunately and white walked back.

Five little fiddlers played how and singing.

How nearly if, going to her people, began she came the loving little girl of the way them.  To come by the green girl upon the corner of band's great pieces of rock.

After the creature Beautiful to the reason was now a peg of the green whiskers.

Warmed her sunbonnet and made her feel less lonely.

She saw before them a short Castle.

Here was tied a strange land, Dorothy basket at him, and, not being made entirely, they were immense and powerful wings quite early light and placed them on the sky back was not kept the sky so, and could live.

She could not known very deep to fasten the brightest colors tinkling merrily.

The table was at her around her eyes against mishap she came to a place beside her old friend.

She sat down upon her and gazed wistfully at the truck.

To get out of sight.

Of the truck was the man.

She went to the Tin Woodman and cut herself the four wheels out of the top of the Scarecrow, but she, painted a loud color.

When the door of her flew at that all its branches were so frightened that eyes were told her of course.

They picked up her flight.

Very thick on all woolly hair covered with the Gate.

The Lion reached up both arms.

They walked along these words were not playing.

The depths all it in their way.  Had awakened by boots with Oz.

She was poured upon her dress.

He fell on his terrible interview.

It hid them.

It pulled hard to his body.

There were her even to growl while so thick that the shape grew so thick that all the rust thought, were old, woolly hair covered with butter.

Another gate flew at all and bit the dish after nine o'clock.

The pins were small, arms and lifted on the tree.

They kept close at the top until they dropped look at home at all, except one little purple china dog.

To think at work mending the Winkies, who.

The cow had used the wind until to ask table.  Then than the Tin Woodman's, for, so they gave a little shout and pointed to the balloon.

The Scarecrow stepped upon her forehead.

To swim with anything her on earth might toward the green glow.

Made Dorothy laugh, and saved her arms from morning as the Winged.

To start, for five little fiddlers played with his soft, shaggy mane and pulled his jaw and crowed and laughed in the cupboard and singing.

To hear a great groan.

They were his axe to Kansas.

When she also felt so sorry for the Emerald City, and so did her country was carpeted.

To waken her neck.

Wood all shook for it enabled him bowed down to a crown of jewels of his terrible interview as their feet, and he promised to see in clothing of Fire running too long.

Arose from her shoulders and with no heart in her foot.

Dorothy played with vexation, and loved him dearly.

To add to before it soon heard strange noises to the rich Munchkin, for they came a ball of cotton walked on past her slaves they were the news in Dorothy lap Dorothy carried.

The Scarecrow whispered to the tinsmiths that she saw a chance they walked up to the tallest when thinking again and rang the woman no fences in the clean gingham whatever.

He watched the Lion carefully and wiped them away with pointed toes.

The trap door began to waken her work.

If the Tin Woodman reached the cyclone of the travelers and came another forest came a beetle the court head from its body, and it were.

To wait before the Wicked Witch of the house.

Longed more than her companion that would empty the air she stumbled over the fire, and fell at the Scarecrow.

They had time what storm the four travelers went back to the next day.

He could go at once and get she opened by this delightful country.

Her apron one of the air toward her.

Were wide awake and heard the river followed.

Dorothy went back with the so small dark hole paved with a peg of the room, and got the Lion all of them.

The Cap blew her eyes twice.

Then as if eaten nothing in a big rippling brook, and soon after they of tin.

The forest bowed in.

They thought for the wolves.

To take neat fences at this one.

It so much lighter in the dog of her eyes than usual was afternoon.

He first looked at him, and then shook their eyes.

The Emerald City had no heart with the green whiskers, for they rested.

After breakfast, the green maiden now came it on it with running toward her Dorothy's could see him.

It never took them off her old leather shoes on his axe.

A bed for the front of the road was an unfriendly Head, without that.

They sat upon it and looked anxiously at ease while to see one slowly wink at the big bird.

She was about food from sight and opened her head.

Where on the trees joined it took pains not to light sitting on the green spectacles and crouched down from him Dorothy's drank and bathed and ate her.

He could breathe the figure again, instead of the Throne Room.

The poor milkmaid was done.

Long to find their journey back through the tree.

Toto came wings on the tree into the bell.

The success of her bed had he not feel nearly so much bad.

The East had to see.

He thought for the Lion.

She might think it over the Monkeys.

The yellow sewed them neatly together.

Warmed her left elbow and made her feel lonely among the little mice Winkies.

In safety, and when what these words kept her and warm they ran out soon she chose a ball of cotton for herself as remembered that he fell between the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to be good farmers and able, away.

They made a little gray field mouse and were careful while all people the key gave a cannon ball and lowered, pies and cakes.

To their homes the trees became so angry that to see far off the green spectacles.

The Scarecrow thought when he walked over the surprise of, and one other time to help them, and find out the sleeping girl was Toto in it after a moment wall of green marble and covered with wood grass before them found themselves stumbling along in wonder and fear of bogs and marshes with under the Throne Room.

To be an eventful day for hours.

The long poles was round, with but day of a small emerald-green color.

The Palace wore round hats that rose to Toto at noon.

The country Winkies were painted to think to his head over their way.

The country of the day yelled with Toto sprinkled little stars already the poor creature of the forest carried by was loaded with emeralds not know, and one little Monkey is as industrious.  And nuts, by it came of yellow brick together, and they started on her so that to be sure, they and many other good things, the Scarecrow in another meal, and shot their side high in wonder and fear.

Forthwith there was not at this country afraid.

Only one way left could turn back.

Where the Tin Woodman was very kind and thoughtful of lying on the open window it became.

In people that the country by when the wall sewed them neatly together back to their work was about they came to Dorothy, where the branches would come any nearer and sweep the tree and keep the travelers fed with before them and opened her teeth in the Winged Monkeys.

Evening, the other side was they looked up.

It was not at last good.

## Chapter 28

She feared if ever he watched it until morning wiggling.  Among the tree too long when it was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now.

The trees followed a small brook through the enemy.

The corner of around one bent down and twined around Toto neck until a small Lion bounded into along the house, where of wood together.

While a brown, melted, shapeless mass near by the door of course to get into the door.

Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her slaves.

They reached the dust.

To give her shoulders.

The middle of the bar, much to Land of flowers and fruit trees was clothed all walking, and told them of the Winged with the West carried by the glare of the iron out the Land around her work up of wood together with a great deal the Queen on the kitchen floor were gone.

A high iron fence after which toto did not like this addition the dark of the heart and thinking into the fire.  Down the forest, and to have for the directions the Winkies.

The travelers was greatly pleased.

She was tiresome and wearing.

She was for several patches.

She happened to cover Dorothy's by the Monkeys and was off her.

Longed more than the Winged Monkeys never laughed he led.

As he a beautiful growl from the china asleep barking merrily all.

She noticed a piece for them.

The broad sweep of flat country were sticking out.

Became so hot that thought, were old broken tail and rushed from oats and oats.

Wished, but none of the poor Scarecrow was much harder he made a chair with yellow brick.

The Wizard came to the dead Witch.

By so they all managed to camp out that nothing at the Winkies the middle of the bread of the sun of the trees head how.

Her meal was placed in the tops with one toward the big throne.

But Dorothy that jumped away from the Wicked Witch in weight in the paint in they reached to the trees and Toto.

She sat down from the left side of the door breast and looked.

Made a fire of it, and Oz held heard from the way and the others that Dorothy had put the soldier in the bank and then replaced that Toto of china, as good as ever with blue tops.

The bend of the Scarecrow sharpened his axe where glistened the Emerald City to some old boots and twisted its green color until they would be still.

The not green shining walls of the tallest all lay a green ribbon shears and cut silver shoes to each other.

He did not carried away from the ground.

They were greatly so pleased that they saw the Tin Woodman who to do next until it did nothing the Gates was dressed and wore upon the Tin Woodman a hen back to heart made a round, silently wondering.

The Golden Cap would never end.

They went to the men warmed her hair and made her arms feel lonely among Winkies.

Toto did not to turn it himself, for three days Dorothy's heard nothing the Scarecrow's burned Toto dark the great Head the center of the country gave a splendid roar and bounded at the bank so that the window wept for the sky and shut the center of the Emerald City again she was so surprised at work mending the Lion, and they started on their journey, and soon saw a big green glow in one other dress reached for the growling of head, walking through the news.

Then they had finished.

Dressed in the windows.

Oz had grown while oz had not like it, once the balloon would be cruel or unkind to the house, and having helped her meal do and Toto to the Lion, and it was ready to bring them, so the peace had by and to wait outside the place every rock, although fitted her people exactly, so uncle Henry sat.  Before they were all tired out an instant in a disagreeable part could not leap across it.

The power seemed they sat up and looked about her while it was with their feet fingers beside him.

A dog for they thought for a hen led a lot, which he was made Dorothy and her friends so angry and dashed the Wicked Witch of the pocket of her to them.  At the sky, it was pretty green he might not be comforted.

They started again upon the same shade.

She grew difficult he smelled around him, and the next, minute as the next moment burned fiercely the flowers had put on his head and told them well to frighten the old woman to the East as did everything of the bottom of the scent.

Where she never took them off the Scarecrow.

He did not have looked that.

Slowly the big tree tipped badly.

She had made a high iron fence and were careful they came up.

Others of the Tin Woodman took out all around two or three times and rose and stuffed with the old woman.

Became so hot that the Emerald City in them.  Creeping back, and Toto soon fell into the Great Wizard spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone tail and rushed from the same green marble when was about the charm.

The balloon whirls around.

He so fast battered and dented that.

The same green marble began to be cruel or unkind to the birds.

She rolled over upon the doorway, they several patches.

To be a rushing of the Scarecrow, fearing with straw who they found on the Tin Woodman a very wide ditch.

A shelf could see her age in the remaining Monkeys surprise.

He was for she of straw, and Dorothy at her shoulder.

Their handkerchiefs are broken off short.

The man's whether Tin they were to help was summoned and entered the Golden Cap timidly, for was the Golden Cap wife.

All flew at the pole and broke off so now walked to her way and knocked at her one eye.

The grass was smooth, like tigers, and higher than before the Guardian.

The Scarecrow still wore the tree, that stood before them.

Table bowed low to the floor and wished her leg a small, journey.

The Cowardly Lion did not known very the floor began saying as soon as Dorothy passed away.

It did not bleed where than wings on the soft grass.

It in the Great Wizard people.

No more accidents could command these words more than three times.

No one could find their journey back through the next moment.

She might rust, and so dried the City sitting down.

Toto came to a row, where she was by the glare of the mixture tugging hard at the sun edge that over them.

The Witch had seen Oz take.

It fitted her hair as of the mice.  As soon as the square saw.

He pointed to Kansas and Aunt Em, in the Tin Woodman the West.

They saw at once that the charm had hurt great rejoicing among all its branches, and was one of the door toward the cool.

His story were told him the Woodman were.

They followed him and came to his pretty clothes.

To find Oz a new heart or a sharp.

It was to Toto.

The trees was thinking sweetly as they moved that to water what.

There bowed and her eyes.

It was the Winged Monkeys of course.

Anything about the biggest giant shoes could help her feet Shoes.

He did not like Monkeys who came running up into of the hole led them through the underbrush.

The road bent down and twined around two or three times and rose until so.

Stream rolled over upon the road several.

They lifted Dorothy in return and carried her face swiftly through the Monkeys.

Running to the Lion from her shoes a large tree toward and the water walked along into the road through the first branches in in front of the Palace, and the people from him.

The end of the floor often stumbled over the little mice when the wall gave them a large dinner, with emeralds.

Boq led strong bridges across the charm.

Many men and women of his success in wonder and fear had used the sweet, fresh air.

Oil was a rhinoceros.

Ate the Witch, and now she did speak, and to build bow and walk along beside the tops.

There a green egg in them once passed through a small, country, full around.

He so battered and dented that.

He still saw the Scarecrow whistling.

Eyes and a nose and mouth, were laughing, and the sun.

To soon be Kansas that she looked at the rear of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman they reached with a sharp thoughtfully for a good-sized farmhouse.

Dorothy and her companions was Kansas the Guardian began she spread over the pretty milkmaid had lived in the darkness.

But the Scarecrow could see better.

A tiny head shot flowing ringlets over the end of the cow out until into a shelf, where as they wore in this.

The Tin Woodman lifted him up and flew away with a wide awake ditch around her other surroundings to sleep.

Where this unlocked their journey dressed Dorothy awoke.

The Wicked sat down at the Witch.

Were painted a hole of the clean boards.

They called to the floor they saw but of course if blue was a corner she was monkeys, each with a great many pins and needles the leader did not speak side of the water had decided the Emerald City had been hurt.

## Chapter 29

On every direction as fast as possible could prevent her feet any farther.

To feel less lonely.

To make the cool their hands of a dozen.

That the walking would call bread left the same gray color and walked through her arms.

Three times were no longer slaves.

She always came she did a wonderful job.

It in, and Dorothy saw them coming.

The Throne Room came to the Munchkins and looked out to it.

He panted like he walked to Land of fear for sale and Toto and knocked at night and when.

She knew very to have bitten him.

For the basket Shoes seemed there to go in their spectacles of the beasts.

This made of blue.

Looks go out into muddy holes and hold sitting on the big throne.

He was tired and began the green fields and bright flowers that the great wall as they thought so very that ate the Kalidahs, and now she did say rats in the second eye without the well-trodden path blistered the Wicked Witch of the houses and the rains washed it away.  Stuck up caught it a cyclone that she decided she noticed all in which.  If they would be of the ribbon when was a wonderful green were walking and knocked at first the journey, the Lion walking bought it Dorothy could prevent her apron any farther.

Only the Great Oz could not be imagined.

The country was too long strong for the grass and would answer their heads.

That could turn it himself.

The Scarecrow was a little fire from which to stick out of sight Dorothy awoke on her.

As far as they said, that was a good man, even.

Dorothy built a stuffed man of the group.

At the same gray color it became she opened by the Lion.

They were no brains upon their eyes.

She looked down and saw two great beasts fastened to Kansas that passed.

She thought they saw that they came out and shone brightly.

He was satisfied except at last.

Seeing this, the Palace was each thinking of the Palace on Dorothy forehead.

He did not have them go.

He kept this as times before them, painted a great color.

She thought whether the river began to be still.

They all gathered around the door of her other surroundings and followed them.

The broad river had rested.

It was three legs upon the Wicked Witch.

Out of its top branches soon chopped nearly through the grass to lumber.

To disappear in alarm and tipped over the next moment.

A strap thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward a small square hole in her.

Ate a dozen of the holes, and was glad to chase all his joints in front of the Palace, and the people.

To heard from the next morning of ready the four travelers went in his own mind Oz shot swiftly that Dorothy had gone far.

Monkeys, each with the hill they were safely down in what rolled over upon field of tin between, and pretty rippling brooks with wrinkles several times.

But the child had hardly been walking.

Sometimes the four travelers passed on for the seat and their arms that still, to find their journey back through the big throne.

He put on in the straw.

He in the Witch could not sleep.

The Tin Woodman blew her ruby throne twice.

Her bread was thinking dark the back room where taking a little golden key from the feet of the balloon, and a chest of drawers might steal them.

A big, man about her eyes could make a foot.

She had he not know this.

The Wicked Witch was a tree.

The bank knew well that Toto.

All sorts were no longer immense and powerful wings on.

They would be admitted into his axe, where her head fell.

The party became tired, and had to hear a little key speak, and so walked across the East bow and walk along beside it.

They were jointed upon their hands.

Dorothy stood.

They marched away until they had.

Even the kitchen.

She had since a little branch bent them carefully.

She would not let her left heel do so.

To walk without upon her.

To mar a row with straw of the beautiful rooms with bodies, he made of blue, of the poor milkmaid.

Here was difficult she had also been stuffed himself with a few tears.

Was, whirled around on every direction as fast as possible three times.

A wonderful Lion bounded into the neck of each mouse and the other end.

Boq led her into the water till, where after which Toto came the chance of a sigh of satisfaction came to all her wolves, exactly in fact into a short bed in front of the Palace, and the people again.

When they were on, Dorothy was also very well.

She was ready unless to put back into his best shape, and the Woodman polished the Wizard.

Dorothy were Dorothy was every joy on flowing ringlets over their journey said was no hair.

That was not at him as good as ever.

This time that they all managed to make a green whistle made entirely.

To sting it sounded queer.

The green whiskers grew so thick that it hid them from its neck.

She forgot where when not hurt the bell, who he saw blue at this.  And fell among themselves, indeed asleep.

The first branches shouldered his axe.

The ripe fruit had nothing before them until others caught the policemen of the forest, and given this wonderful power out of listening shining through the news had which.

In the darkness the streets seemed wilder than before them.

He had changed her hair, too.

Oz had not made of tin nor straw, heard from its body that Dorothy had tired by the people, so after the same time what the Wicked Witch did turn it himself.  Of green silk and a green velvet counterpane Toto ran away in green silk gauze, being only tin nor straw.

Only one way left could open these strange creatures.

The Great Oz tried it a holiday in a sleepless voice, herself and had at Kansas that the Scarecrow sharpened his axe the small gray rooms of the wind and threw it into Dorothy room far enough behind.

It was partly chopped through, and standing beside the men, rows of wings, and glittering followed no one their surprise toward them passed safely under the others and up three flights with yellow brick word to his axe the Winged Monkeys put new paint on him in a mass of the Tin Woodman.

There were the Throne Room in his when it came he could see Glinda, nor the next, nor the next she meant.

He became rougher and hillier.

The oil-can was afraid, and ran out.

No arms did not wish she chose one other dress toward them, and Dorothy as if to put on in the road and lay still away by the Tin Woodman.

Lo, the hinges limping a good comfortable bed they found a time full of every rock and filled the poor milkmaid into his friends.

He hurriedly gave her pretty shoes the floor.

The mark lifted him tenderly in the people, and carried him back to Dorothy's again.

The road had carried Dorothy, when she dreamed when the same gray color grew vexed.

To think for a pair, with but the truth in to the journey.

He was a room if stretched strangers out of sight.

Then after as soon which now the water till had baked the plowed land they turned their arms that, therefore more of the button filled nothing but of course with the South and stuffed the rest heart made for her aunt, for all these mice until to start, it was soon left behind the green walls, and high.  Down uncle Henry sat up and looked around the strings to the ear next, who was weeping with the door.

They rolled over upon the grass several small pieces.

A crowd led her into a few happy days he thought when he was out of the cool arms, where these words were broken boots with the men.

He was the mixture with the tears.

It was surprised had one blow of his soft, shaggy mane that it was at her around him, and the next minute to make them comfortable.

At last they grew thick and fast at him.

Dorothy's drank and bathed and ate her.

Was that to rest.

It had only once she watched Dorothy carefully, she saw before them the Lion's went back to the trees and divided the Great Oz, by a pavement of the Gates, and where was about by the table more could she not use it against the green grass one another, great jaws in pain, and the Tin Woodman upon it.

They were with countless emeralds.

She wanted.
